### Why is writing articles important?

You might be wondering why writing is important. After all, as a developer, your day-to-day life will be spent writing code, not Medium articles. The answer is that as a developer, you need to write great code, of course, but you'll also be expected to write documentation. Writing articles also makes you more attractive to hiring managers because it shows them that you can communicate your ideas with clarity to an audience. This is really important to hiring managers.

To write great documentation, you need to be a great writer, and the only way to become a great writer is through practice.
