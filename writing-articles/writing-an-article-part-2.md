# Writing an article - Part 2

## Learning objectives

- Complete an article in English about a technical or non-technical topic and share online.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

In part 1 of this exercise, you learned why it was important to write articles, and also learned the different steps to writing an article. You also created the outline of your article. In Part 2 here, you will write out the full article and share it online.

### Why is writing articles important?

Because as we mentioned in Part 1, writing articles will help you get better at writing documentation, which is essential for a developer to do in their job. It also helps makes you more attractive to hiring managers because it shows them that you can communicate your ideas with clarity to an audience. This is really important to hiring managers and a good reason for you to start writing articles.

### Writing your first article using your created outline

In this exercise, you are going to work on the outline of your article you created in Part 1 and expand on it to create a complete written article.

### Proofreading your article

Once your article is completed, it's now time to make sure there are no grammar or spelling errors. This is called proofreading and it is very important because you don't want a hiring manager to see mistakes in your article. This could make them think you have difficulty expressing yourself in English so we want to avoid that.

### Sharing your article online

This is another crucial step in writing. You can write as many articles as you want but if you don't share them with the world, no one will know they exist. Sharing your articles online helps others see your technical skills and how you communicate them. This, in turn, will help you build a strong reputation so that hiring managers feel more confident in interviewing or hiring you for roles.

In this exercise, you'll be using Medium to share your article online since it's fairly quick and easy to do. Just follow the steps in the first link mentioned below, and you'll be a published author in no time!
