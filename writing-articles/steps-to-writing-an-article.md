# Steps to writing an article
Remember that we are not trying to write the perfect essay for your English class. We are just using these steps to make it easy for you to start your article. If you are already a confident writer, feel free to follow the process that best suits you.

1. **Pick a topic:** What is your article about? What question are you answering?

    **Here are a few prompts to help you choose a topic:**

    - *Describe your journey with software development.*
    - *What has been the biggest challenge that you have faced so far in your journey with software development?*
    - *What is the biggest non-technical lesson that you have learned in your journey as a developer?*
    - *What are 3 pieces of advice that you would give someone who's just beginning their journey with software development today?*
    - *What aspect(s) of your pre-Microverse life is now helping you become a better developer?*

2. **Create** **a thesis statement**: Your thesis statement is the answer to your topic or prompt. Simply put, if you were to answer your prompt in just one sentence, what would that sentence be? Your thesis statement should be concise, yet it should contain all of the key parts of your answer.

    **Here is an example of a thesis statement:**

    - **Chosen prompt:** *What aspect(s) of your pre-Microverse life is now helping you become a better developer?*

    **Example of a thesis statement for the chosen prompt above:**

    - *"There are two skills that I got as an English teacher that today are helping me become a better developer: the patience to teach others and the ability to communicate my ideas".*

3. **Write your opening statement:** Your opening statement can be a question, a fun fact, or a bold statement that catches the reader's attention.

    **Here are some examples of opening sentences:**

    - *Did you know that it is now possible to code from anywhere in the world?*
    - *"A year ago, if you had told me that my 8 years as an English teacher in a Colombian elementary school would help me become a software developer, I probably would've laughed..."*
    - *What do an elementary English teacher and a web developer have in common? A month ago I would've expected that sentence to be the start of a really bad joke..."*

4. **Combine your opening statement and thesis statement:** Now combine sentences from Steps 3 and 2, to create a full introduction sentence.

    **Here's an example of how your article draft should be looking now:**

    - *What do an elementary English teacher and a web developer have in common? A month ago I would've expected that sentence to be the start of a really bad joke but actually, I've noticed that there are two skills that I got as an English teacher that today are helping me become a better developer: the patience to teach others and the ability to communicate my ideas".*

5. **Create the outline of** **your first paragraph:** Now it's time to expand on your thesis statement to create the body of your article and divide it into paragraphs. To do this, pick an important point from the thesis statement created in point 2, and use this to help you create the outline of your first paragraph.

    **Using the thesis statement in Step 2, here's an example of creating the outline of your first paragraph:**

    - A bullet point I chose from my thesis above is:
        - *The patience to teach others*
    - The outline for my first paragraph based on the bullet point above can be:
        - First paragraph outline: *"I will discuss how having the patience to teach others has helped me become a better coding partner. I will use the specific example where my patience helped my partner understand how databases work."*

6. **Create the outline of** **your second paragraph:** Now it's time to expand on your thesis statement to create the body of your article and divide it into paragraphs. To do this, pick an important point from the thesis statement created in point 2, and use this to help you create the outline of your second paragraph.

    **Using the thesis statement in Step 2, here's an example of creating the outline of your second paragraph:**

    - A bullet point I chose from my thesis above is:
        - *The ability to communicate my ideas well*
    - The outline for my first paragraph based on the bullet point above can be:
        - Second paragraph outline*: "I will discuss how my ability to communicate my ideas well has helped me write better documentation. I will use the specific example where I wrote documentation for an HTML/CSS, and how I used it to help my Stand-Up Team understand my code".*

7. **Create your conclusion outline:** What do you want readers to take away from your article? Your conclusion should wrap up your ideas into a nice little paragraph.

    **Here are some examples of conclusion outlines:**

    - I will r*e-write that my experiences as an English teacher have helped me to have the patience to teach others and become a better partner to fellow developers.*
    - *I will end by encouraging others to use their past experiences to help them become better developers.*
    - *I will tell my readers that the key takeaways from this article are XXX and YYY...*
    - *I will re-inform my readers of the benefit of practicing skills and using them.*
    - *I will explain how I will continue to work on these skills at Microverse and beyond (once I get a job as a developer)"*
    - *I will ask my readers to share their thoughts and comments.*
