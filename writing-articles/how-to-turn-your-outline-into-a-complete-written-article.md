# How to turn your outline into a complete written article
To create a complete article, you have to expand your outlines into stories. Remember that you already have the following from your first exercise in Part1:

- a first paragraph outline
- a second paragraph outline
- a conclusion outline

Let's first look at how to expand on the paragraph outlines to create a full story.

### How to expand on paragraph outlines

To do this, make sure your paragraph outline has a skill you want to showcase and a specific example showcasing that skill. Let's use the example below to explain this:

**Example of a paragraph outline:** 

*"Here I will discuss how having the patience to teach others has helped me become a better coding partner. I will talk about the specific example where my patience was helpful in helping my partner understand how databases work."*

You can see in the example above that we have 2 main parts:

- The skill we want to showcase which is "*having the patience to teach others*"
- The specific example which is "*the time when my patience was helpful in helping my partner understand how databases work."*

**Expanding the paragraph outline:** 

Once you have the skill and the specific example, expand on them by recalling what happened in that specific example you chose. You can also ask yourself some guiding questions to help you recall what happened and create your story.  

Some guiding questions could be:

- *What was the situation? What was I working on at that time?*
- *How did my skill help my partner?*
- *How did my partner feel after I provided that skill?*
- *How did I feel after providing that skill?*

These questions will guide you into writing your story and expanding on your paragraph outlines.

### How to expand on conclusion outlines

Expanding on conclusion outlines tends to be easier and really depends on what conclusion outline you pick. In any case, your expansion should be short, sweet, and straight to the point. 

Here are some examples of conclusion outlines and their expansions to guide you:

- **Conclusion outline 1:** I w*ill tell my readers that the key takeaways from this article are XXX and YYY.*
- **Conclusion expansion 1:** *"So the key takeaways from this article are XXX and YYY. I hope you enjoyed reading."*
- **Conclusion outline 2:**  *I will ask my readers to share their thoughts and comments*
- **Conclusion expansion 2:** *"So did you like reading this article? Please feel free to share your thoughts and comments!."*
- **Conclusion outline 3:**  *I will re-inform my readers of the benefit of practicing skills and using them*
- **Conclusion expansion 3:** *"So the benefit of practicing these skills is that you get XXX. I hope this was useful information for you. See you in my next article."*
