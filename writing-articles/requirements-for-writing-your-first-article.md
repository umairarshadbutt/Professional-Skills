# Requirements for writing your first article
1. **Make it about software development**: Whether you are writing a technical or non-technical article, try to relate it somehow to software development. We'll guide you with some suggestions for a topic on the main page of this exercise.
2. **Make it short and sweet**: Remember, the purpose of this article is to get you comfortable writing, not to create the perfect article. We recommend you aim for a short 500-word post.
3. **Don't spend too much time on it**: Overthinking writing an article can lead to writer's block where you feel incapable of starting. Instead of overthinking it, think "MVP" (minimum viable product). Just like code, you can always improve on it later on as you get ready for your job search.
