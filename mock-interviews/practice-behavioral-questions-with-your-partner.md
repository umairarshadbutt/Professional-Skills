# Practice behavioral questions with your partner

## Learning objective

- Successfully complete a phone screen, a common first step in an interview process.

### **Estimated time**: 0.75h

## Description

 In this exercise, you will practice answering behavioral questions with your partner. You will also practice giving them constructive feedback on their performance.

### Why is practicing behavioral questions important?

Behavioral questions are usually asked in every interview, and at every interview stage. The most common stage where this occurs is the phone screen, which is the first call you have with the recruiter. Behavioral questions help the recruiter understand you better and help them determine whether you are a good cultural fit for the company. Recruiters tend to look out for skills like communication, collaboration, teamwork, and leadership. This is why it is important to practice your behavioral questions and answers beforehand so you can perform well in real-life interviews. You will continue to do these while you job search to keep your interviewing skills strong.
