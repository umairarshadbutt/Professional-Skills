# Use feedback to set some interview-related SMART goals

## Learning objectives

- Practice how to gather feedback to analyze performance and make adjustments after an interview.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Description

In this exercise, you will use the feedback you gathered in your mock interviews to create interview-related SMART goals.

### Why is setting interview-related SMART goals important?

Because you can have 1 million interviews, but if you do not learn anything from them, you will not improve your interviewing skills and this will decrease your chances of performing well in each interview. SMART goals help you see what you need to improve on, help you turn it into a goal, and help you work towards this goal so that you have a clear path of improvement.

### Reminder on how to create SMART goals

In the activity "[*Goal Setting Day to Day, Week to Week*](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/goal-setting-day-to-day-week-to-week.md)", you learned what SMART goals were and you created your first SMART goal. Here you will use the same SMART goals technique to create your interviewing SMART goals.

### Reminder on gathering feedback in an interview

In the lesson *["How to analyze your performance in a mock interview"](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/mock-interviews/how-to-analyze-your-performance-in-a-mock-interview.md),* you were introduced to a feedback template with questions to ask your mock interviewer about your performance. We hope that you have used this template to gather feedback during your peer mock interviews so that you can do this exercise properly.
