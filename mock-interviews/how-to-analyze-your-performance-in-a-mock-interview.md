### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to gather feedback from your mock interviewer and analyze your performance in order to improve your interviewing skills.

### Why is analyzing your performance in a mock interview important?

The key to becoming really good in interviews is being able to analyze your performance after each interview, establishing what you did well and what you can improve upon, and then making changes. The first step to analyzing your performance is to gather feedback from your mock interviewer. The constructive feedback they give you will let you know what to improve for future interviews. 

### Gathering feedback at the end of your interview

 After your mock interview, we recommend that you gather feedback on your performance. The best time to do this is at the end of the interview by asking them questions. To help you get this feedback, we have created the template below with a list of questions you can use. Make sure to take notes in the template as the interviewer is giving you feedback so you can reflect on them later on.

### Using a growth mindset to analyze the feedback you receive

Receiving constructive feedback from your mock interviewer can create feelings of imposter syndrome, making you feel like you are not good enough for interviews. This is a good time to remind yourself of the growth mindset, why it is important and how to practice it. Having a growth mindset is particularly important when interviewing because you will be doing a lot of interviews and the best way to be great at interviewing is by learning from the previous ones so that you can perform better in the future ones.
