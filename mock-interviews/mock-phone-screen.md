# Mock phone screen

## Learning objective

- Successfully complete a phone screen, a common first step in an interview process.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will practice doing a phone screen with both behavioral and technical questions.

### Why are mock phone screens important?

Phone screens are usually the first stage of any interview process. Doing a mock phone screen will help you practice your technical and behavioral skills to see where your strengths are and where you need to improve. This, in turn, will help you perform better in real phone screens. 

### Guidelines to completing your phone screen

In this exercise, you will watch a few videos of career coach Eric who will act as a recruiter and ask you both behavioral and technical questions. Each of your answers should be no longer than 3 minutes so make sure you set a timer next to you. In the end, you will self-assess how you did on the phone screen.
