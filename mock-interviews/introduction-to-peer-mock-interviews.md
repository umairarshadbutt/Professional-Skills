## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what a technical peer mock interview is and how to do a peer mock interview with your partner.  

### Why are technical peer mock interviews important?

Peer technical mock interviews help you practice your technical skills and see where your strengths are and where you need to improve. This, in turn, will help you perform better in real interviews. You will continue to do these while you job search to keep your interviewing skills strong. 

### What is a technical peer mock interview?

This is an interview where you will ask your peer a list of technical questions, evaluate their answers and give them constructive feedback. Then your peer will do the same for you. 

### How to do your technical peer mock interview

You and your partner must complete at least 2 peer mock interviews to help prepare you for interviews with actual companies: a behavioral interview and a technical interview. Youâ€™ve already completed the behavioral interview, so next, you will complete the technical mock interview. You will find the detailed instructions at the link below. Read through this, so you understand what is coming next. 
**You do not need to complete the interview now, this is just a moment for you to get familiar with the material, the questions, and be prepared to show up to your upcoming peer mock interview session.**
