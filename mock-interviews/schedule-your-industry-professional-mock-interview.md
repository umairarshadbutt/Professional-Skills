### Why is scheduling your industry mock interview important?

Your industry mock interview is an opportunity to have an interview with a professional software developer. This will give you the feeling of what a real interview is like and prepare you for the real interviews you will have in the future.

### How to carefully schedule your industry mock interview

To start, you will need to fill out a form to request an industry mock interview with an interviewer. Once you are matched with an interviewer, you will receive an email introduction with a link to your interviewerâ€™s Calendly so that you can schedule the most convenient time you can find that works for you.
