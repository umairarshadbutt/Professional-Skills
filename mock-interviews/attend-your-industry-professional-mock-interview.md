# Attend your industry professional mock interview

## Learning objectives

- Show up prepared and on time to an interview with an industry professional.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will be attending your industry mock interview.

### Why is attending your industry mock interview important?

Because the industry mock interview is a great opportunity for you to get a feel of a real interview and thus, help you prepare for real interviews you will have in the future.

### How to show up prepared and on time to your industry mock interview

In the previous exercise *[Schedule your industry professional mock interview](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/mock-interviews/schedule-your-industry-professional-mock-interview.md),* you scheduled your interview with an Industry mock interviewer. It is now your time to do your interview and this exercise gives you enough time to do this. 

As always, it is important to be prepared and on time for an interview so make sure to do the following before your mock interview too:

- Set up a reminder in your calendar to alert you at least 15 minutes before the interview so you can prepare.
- Test your audio and camera settings 10 minutes before the meeting to ensure they are working correctly.
- Make sure you are smartly dressed and that you look professional.
- Have a pen and paper by your side in case you need to take notes during the interview.

### Assessment of your performance after the interview

Once you have finished your industry mock interview, you will fill out a self-assessment of your performance in the exercise template below. The goal is to help you identify areas of strength and weakness so that you can use this to continue improving your interview skills. Your industry professional mock interviewer will also complete a feedback form as well and we will share this feedback with you when received. This is a great opportunity for you to analyze the feedback you receive and use it to create a plan of improvement for yourself. The link below is a good reminder of how to use the feedback you receive to create SMART goals for improvement.

### What if my interview is scheduled in the next few days/week? What should I do?

You should still submit this exercise as long as you have your interview scheduled. We highly recommend you still use the exercise template to keep track of your interview progress and feedback once you have had it.
