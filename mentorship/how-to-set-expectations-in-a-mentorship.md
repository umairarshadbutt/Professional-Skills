# How to set expectations in a mentorship

It is important as a mentee to make a list of expectations for what you hope to achieve from a mentorship. This will be an important guide to choosing a mentor that is suitable for you. Here is a list of questions we recommend you ask yourself before searching for a mentor:

- What do I hope to achieve from the mentorship?
- How much time am I willing and able to commit?
- Do I need my mentor to be in the same time zone as me? Which timezones work well for me?
- Should the mentorship meetings be once a week, twice a week, once a month, or ad-hoc?
- Is this mentorship open-ended or do I just need a few sessions?
- What will my primary method of communication be? Would it be Slack? or Zoom? or another communication method?
- How do I want to track my progress with my mentor?
- What type of support do I want my mentor to provide?

### Understanding the type of support you want from your mentor

Different mentors can provide different kinds of support, so it is really important to know what type of support you would like to have from a mentor. This will help you guide your first conversation with them and help you determine whether they are a good fit for you.

Here are some types of support mentors can provide:

- **Technical knowledge:** Mentors who are more experienced in a certain language can provide this support to a mentee. ****
- **Professional skills support:** Mentors can help a mentee further develop their professional skills like interviewing, team communication, or other professional skills.
- **Career advice:** This will depend on the amount of experience the mentor has in the tech industry. Some mentors will be able to give advice to mentees on how to get and keep a job, how to ask for a salary raise, how to grow in the tech industry, how to develop a strong tech network and more.
- **General support:** Some mentors like to provide a space where the mentee has concerns that are not tech-related. For example, feeling excluded, anxiety, being bullied by others, dealing with imposter syndrome, and more. These mentors can contribute to a mentee's growth both personally and professionally.

Knowing the type of support you need will help you to find out which mentor can provide this and help you determine if they are a good fit for you.
