# What are a mentor, a mentee, and mentorship?

A professional mentor is someone confident enough with their experiences and knowledge to assist others with less experience or knowledge. A mentor can be a student further in the program than you, an alum who has completed the program, or an external professional who has decided to engage in mentoring activities.

A mentee is someone who aspires to grow their skills in a particular topic or set of topics and needs advice, assistance, support, and/or guidance.

Mentorship is the relationship formed between two people: a mentor and a mentee, in which the mentor provides guidance or shares knowledge with the mentee and the mentee works to improve their skills or confidence.
