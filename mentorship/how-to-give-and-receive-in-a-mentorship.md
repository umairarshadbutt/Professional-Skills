# How to give and receive in a mentorship

The mentee should bring the following skills to the mentorship relationship:

- **Organization skills:** make sure you are on time for your mentorship meetings.
- **Communication skills:** prepare any questions you have in advance.
- **Hard work:** try to make progress (big or small) before each meeting with your mentor. Bring your challenges, wins, and areas you would like to get input on from your mentor.

The mentor, on the other hand, should aim to provide the following services in a mentorship relationship:

- **Agreed type of support:** We saw in the section on setting expectations with your mentor that mentors can provide different types of support to a mentee. Depending on the type of support you both agreed on, your mentor should provide this support.
- **Accountability:** The mentor should establish realistic goals with their mentee and hold them accountable for making constant progress, no matter how big or small. Accountability enables both parties to have a sense of direction and accomplishment when the goal has been attained.
- **Understanding and patience:** This is necessary to keep the relationship peaceful and constructive. Being patient will allow the mentee to feel safer and more confident in their ability to grow. This, in turn, will help increase their motivation to learn more with their mentor.
- **Encouragement**: Mentors should show that they understand the struggles of the mentee and provide genuine encouragement. This is really important.
