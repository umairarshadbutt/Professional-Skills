# What to look out for in a mentor

There are many mentors online but finding the right mentor for you is a careful selection process. You shouldn't just take the first mentor who wants to work with you. You should expect to reach out to several mentors, evaluate them when you have your first conversation, and determine if they are a good fit for you. In the same way, your mentor will also be evaluating if you are a good fit for them during the conversation.

Your first conversation with a potential mentor should not be the start of your mentorship together. This conversation should be a simple coffee chat where you get to know each other and where you can evaluate if this mentor is a right fit for you. Bearing this in mind, we recommend that you always ask to have a coffee chat with a potential mentor first, whether it's a virtual coffee or an in-person one so that you can determine if they are a good fit for you.

Before

To determine whether a mentor is a good fit for you, we recommend preparing a few guiding questions to help you reflect on this. Here are few questions to ask yourself when evaluating a mentor:

- **Do they show signs of patience?** Patience is a really important skill for a mentor to have since they are going to be supporting and helping you grow.
- **Are they good communicators?** Good communicators take time to listen to the mentee and their struggles, rather than just blaming them for not being able to see the solution.
- **Are they willing to listen to my story?** You might be struggling with confidence and need someone to talk to about your tech issues, your bugs, and your general fears about tech. Are they willing to listen to your story?
- **Are they willing to share their story?** A mentor's time, knowledge, experience, and resources are invaluable to you as a mentee as you will appreciate hearing what worked for them, what didnâ€™t work for them, and more. Is your mentor willing to share their story?
- **Do you feel comfortable asking your mentor any questions at all?** This is really important to create trust in the relationship.
