### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what a professional mentor is and how you can find one for yourself.

### Why is finding a professional mentor important?

Professional mentors tend to be more experienced people in a particular topic or set of topics, who are willing to help others grow their skills. They are people excited to give back to the community by helping others develop their technical and professional skills.

Having a mentor will help increase your confidence. You will learn from your mentor's experience, and will also get insight into what the tech industry is like, as well as tips and tricks to progress in the industry. The mentor also gains from this experience as they are able to reinforce their knowledge and even discover things they may not have known. It's a win-win situation for everyone.
