# How to join an online tech community

- Pick the community you want to join:

   As mentioned in the paragraph above, you can either join a tech LinkedIn group or a tech Slack channel.

  - **To join a Meetup group:** Simply type the keyword and location of your interest in the Search bar at the top of the Meetup Home page.
  - **To join tech LinkedIn groups**: simply type the keyword of your interest in the Search bar at the top of your LinkedIn homepage and select (group name) Groups from the dropdown.
  - **To join tech Slack groups:** you can either use the Slofile database mentioned on the main page or join one of the top 10 remote Slack groups mentioned on the main page of this lesson.

- **Sign up to join the community:** For some of them, this may take 1-3 days before the administrator approves your request. Make sure that if you are asked for a reason why you are joining in the sign-up form, that you give a professional reason. For example: "*I am a developer in Ruby and I am looking to meet with other Ruby developers around the world*".
