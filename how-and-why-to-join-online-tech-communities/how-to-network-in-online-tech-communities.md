# How to network in online tech communities

- **Introduce yourself to a person or the whole group:** In LinkedIn groups, you can introduce yourself directly on the main group page by writing a post. In Slack channels, you will notice sub-channels called "*Introductions"* or "*Welcome" where y*ou can write a short message introducing yourself to everyone. For example:

  "*Hi everyone, I am Eric, a Full-stack developer who enjoys working with React and Rails. Nice to meet you all.".*

  Try not to focus on whether people in the channel give you "likes" or "emoji-reactions". The important part is to **focus on what you can control** which is putting yourself out there by introducing yourself.

  If you prefer to introduce yourself to only one person in the group to start, you can do this as well.

- **Explore the group or channel:** Every Slack group has a variety of channels you can join so it is important to explore the channels which are on the left-hand side of the group. Some classic examples of channels are:

  - \#job-board: where job opportunities are posted.
  - \#careers-chat: where career progress and tips are discussed.
  - \#help-react: where you can ask questions on React and get help from others.

- **Like, comment or share posts:** This technique is very common on LinkedIn and can help increase the number of views you get to your LinkedIn profile. The more you engage with other peoples' posts, the more they and their networks notice you thus increasing your visibility to the world.

- **DM people you are interested in speaking with:** If for example, someone in the LinkedIn group or Slack group is offering a job you are interested in, write them a direct message sharing your interest. Slack messaging is a lot "freer" than LinkedIn messaging as it is easier to reach out to people in different job positions without having to connect with them first. If you want to start networking but are anxious about it, Slack groups are a good way to start.

  Whether you are DM'ing through LinkedIn or Slack, make sure to include a link to your portfolio, GitHub, or LinkedIn in your message so they can see your work and determine if you are a good fit.
