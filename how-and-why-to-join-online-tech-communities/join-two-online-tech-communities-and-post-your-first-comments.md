Tech communities are places where fellow techies like you hang out and share ideas, industry information, and job opportunities. Joining communities like these make you and your work more visible to others in the tech world and allows you to connect with junior and senior developers, architects, mentors, or hiring managers. It is a great way to grow your networking skills.
