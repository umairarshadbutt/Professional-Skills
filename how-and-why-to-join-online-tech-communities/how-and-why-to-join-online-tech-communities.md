# Joining and networking in online tech communities

## Learning objectives

- Apply networking skills to join two online tech communities and start engaging.

### Estimated time: .75 hr

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what online tech communities are; why you should join them; which communities to join; and how to network in the communities you join.

### Why is joining an online tech community important?

Online tech communities are places where fellow techies like you hang out and share ideas, industry information, and job opportunities. Joining communities like these make you and your work more visible to others in the tech world and allows you to connect with junior and senior developers, architects, mentors, or hiring managers. The more communities you join, the more you grow your network, and in turn, increase your chances of being contacted for job positions or other opportunities.

### Which online tech communities should I join?

The first part of this lesson focuses on deciding which tech communities you can join.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn which online communities to join.*
