# Sign up to attend a tech-related event

## Learning objectives

- Apply lessons about networking to make connections at a tech-related event.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this exercise, you will practice signing up to attend a tech-related event.

### Why is attending tech-related events important?

Did you know that nearly 70% of job offers are gotten through referrals and connections rather than doing hundreds of job applications on websites? Attending tech events will help build your connections and relationships so that when an opportunity comes knocking, you are already in contact with the recruiter or hiring manager and can reach out to them more easily.

### Which tech-related events should I attend?

Below is a list of websites that offer tech-related events to help you decide which ones to attend.

- [TechMeetups.com](https://techmeetups.com/) - Probably the largest meetup and events site online that offers a wide range of tech events.
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/tech/?page=1) - Eventbrite might primarily be used for social events, but itâ€™s also a great place for finding tech events as well (and many of them are free!).
- [Confs.tech](https://confs.tech/) - is a crowd-sourced site that lists recent tech conferences. You can sort by language and location to find any that might be a good fit for you.
- Your [Microverse Events calendar](https://airtable.com/shrAR9LEzMrF5z0CX/tblUpfLCb0CUHXqqT) which you can also find in the left column of your student dashboard.
- Scouting events hosted by your dream company: In the exercise "*[Define your dream companies](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-your-dream-companies.md)*", you learned how to create your list of dream companies, and how to get hired by them. Attending events hosted by your dream company and networking at them is a very effective way of getting into your dream company.
