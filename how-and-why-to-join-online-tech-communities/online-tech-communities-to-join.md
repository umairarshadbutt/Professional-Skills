# Online tech communities to join

**Meetup groups:** Meetup is an organization that was created to help people who have similar interests connect with each other. Meetups are a fantastic way to grow your network and an opportunity to learn, teach, and meet developers and companies you likely would never have met otherwise and we recommend that you attend one.

**Tech-focused LinkedIn groups:** There are currently more than 2 million active LinkedIn groups. LinkedIn groups are essentially professional forums that focus on a specific topic or industry where members can share, exchange, and discuss information. On average, people who engage in group discussions get an average of four times more profile views than other LinkedIn members. Joining a tech-focused LinkedIn group and engaging in it will help increase the visibility of your LinkedIn profile.

**Tech Slack communities:** Just like you have your Microverse Slack channel where you are in a community with other Micronauts, tech Slack communities are channels where tech professionals are in a community mixing with other tech professionals and tech recruiters. There are over 4,000 Slack channels in the world for different industries. Slofile is a huge public database that allows you to search for any Slack channels. Just type in a keyword and it will bring up all the Slack channels with that keyword. This is a great exploration tool that we highly recommend you take a look at.
