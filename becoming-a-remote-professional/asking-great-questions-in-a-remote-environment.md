# Asking great questions in a remote environment

Practicing asking good questions starts here at Microverse when you have questions for your partners, teammates, or the Microverse staff. The remote environment requires extra effort when asking questions. As Tim Ferriss said, giving examples is important in general, and in a remote environment, giving examples and overall context is even more important! Since the person does not see your computer screen, they will have no information on what is happening for you or why you are asking this question.

How to make a good question in the remote environment:

- Can I ask my questions using Loom so the person can see my screen? (the answer is almost always yes to this question!)
- Can I offer any other examples to make my question more clear or give more context? Can I include screenshots?
- Can I make my question more concrete?
- Does this person have all the information they need to answer my question?
- Are there previous events or actions that this person should know about to answer my question?
- What solutions have I tried to find to this question that did not work? If you're making a Loom video, it's good to include these.
