### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Making strong teams part 2

In this lesson, you will do an exercise together as a team to make sure all team members understand the requirements for strong teams and to think about how might deal with a team member not acting according to the team agreements.

### Why is this important?

To have productive team work that delivers succesful projects, each member needs to take part in following the group agreements, giving good project updates, helping solve blockers, and communicating proactively.

In some cases, team members might not follow these agreements or struggle with some of the above aspects. A good performing team can take action to try and solve this on their own. Later in the workplace, you might have a team member who is not performing well in your team. A pro-active and good team member will always try to solve this first before reaching out to your manager to ask for help. Here at Microverse, we also expect you to take actions to overcome your challenges before reaching out to Student Success.

### Making strong teams

Take a look at the following section to understand what to do if a team member isn't doing part of their work. Being able to communicate with a team member and getting everyone to follow the work agreements is a really important skill for later in the workplace and is a great way to practice leadership skills.

**Guiding questions:**

- What are some of the skills you will learn as a team to try and solve team challenges?
- What is the best way to approach someone who isn't taking part in the team agreements?
