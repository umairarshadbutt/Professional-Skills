# First retrospectives

## Learning objectives

- Learn to view setbacks and failure positively as opportunities to learn.
- Show you know how to use daily update and weekly retrospective forms to drive successful meeting activities.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

The goal of this activity is for you to learn how to use the first weekly retrospectives to reflect on the progress you made the previous week, as well as think about challenges you faced and how to overcome them. 

### What is a retrospective?

Weekly retrospectives are a common practice with software developer teams and technology companies. They can be used by teams or by individuals to look back and evaluate their performance and determine what they did well and what can be improved. Retrospectives are used to celebrate small wins, point out and analyze blockers, see if there are any patterns to performance, and improve based on all those inputs.

### Why are retrospectives important?

Setting goals and reflecting on them is a crucial skill that will help you stay focused and productive.  Clarity of what you need to accomplish will help you balance out the stress of completing the curriculum and will motivate you to keep working hard to achieve your ultimate goals at Microverse.

We ask you to set weekly goals through your weekly retrospective as it will allow you to better understand how you can continuously improve yourself. The continuous reflection which comes with the weekly retrospective will help you see patterns on what your strengths are, and what areas of improvement exist for you.

## Exercise

### Instructions

Before you start filling in your first retrospective, there are a few key areas you have to think about and critically assess. In order to do so, remember that your retrospective should be about how you performed throughout the full week, and not just about whether you hit all your targets on Friday. Before filling in the form, ask yourself the following questions: 

1. **What did I accomplish this week?**

    Think about what goals you set for yourself the previous week. Did you complete all of them? What went really well and why? Take a minute to congratulate yourself for those things you excelled at and accomplished. Celebrate those small weekly wins which get you one step closer to your ultimate goal of becoming a developer.

2. **What were my challenges this week?**

    Think about what was left unfinished or didn't go well for you this week. Did you run into any problems or experience any blockers? What could you have done to avoid or mitigate those issues? Be as honest as possible, since identifying the correct issue will help you avoid these challenges in the following weeks.

3. **What one thing will I do differently next week?**

    What are your goals and objectives for next week; what do you want to accomplish? Think about the personal productivity, time management, and professional goals you are working on, in addition to coding and the curriculum. Taking into consideration your insights from last week, write down one thing you will do differently in the coming week to work towards your goals.
