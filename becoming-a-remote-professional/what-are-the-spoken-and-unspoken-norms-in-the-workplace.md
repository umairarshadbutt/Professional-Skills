# What are the spoken and unspoken norms in the workplace?

Norms are divided into two categories: spoken and unspoken norms. The spoken norms are usually written down in an official document called a "*Code of Conduct"* and everybody in the company must adhere to those norms for the team to work well together.

Here are some examples of common spoken norms in the workplace:

- No sexual harassment accepted
- No racist, ageist or homophobic comments allowed
- No unprofessional behavior towards colleagues and clients will be tolerated

The second category called unspoken norms is a bit harder to figure out but is absolutely essential. Unspoken norms are sometimes called "*common-sense rules*" but it is not all that common because we all come from different cultures and backgrounds. This is why it is important to analyze your workplace and see how your colleagues behave, and from there you will understand the unspoken norms and follow them.

Here are some examples of common unspoken norms in the workplace:

- Always be on time to meetings and make sure to look professional
- Do not smoke or vape during a meeting
- Always have your camera on in a meeting and mute your microphone when you are not talking.
- Always be polite and nice in your emails to your co-workers. Never be rude.
