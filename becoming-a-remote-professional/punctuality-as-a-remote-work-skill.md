# Punctuality as a remote work skill

Punctuality is a wonderful trait of a person, one to be admired and respected. Punctuality displays a person’s respect for people and time, but it is a concept that also varies across cultures. In some cultures, the late-comer in a scheduled appointment usually gives an impression that they don't value the other person’s time or considers their time more important than that of the other.

Throughout your study at Microverse, you will learn more about professionalism skills and punctuality. You will have the opportunity to practice these skills and show punctuality in your interaction with colleagues and your daily activities.

Below is a video of our Microverse Alumni talking about punctuality in their culture and what they've learned at Microverse in the workplace:

### Benefits of punctuality at work

Punctuality is more important at the workplace because it is here that you get compensated for the hours you put in and build a career. Employees are expected to be punctual and dependable to meet the needs of the organization. When employees are absent or tardy, work and service are interrupted, and an additional burden is placed on colleagues. Punctuality is one of the important factors in evaluating individual performance and continued employment. In remote work, punctuality means being available online during office hours, logging in into meetings punctually, and meeting project deadlines.

Here are the benefits of being punctual at work:

- Punctuality speaks of a person’s respect for others. In giving respect to others, we can earn respect in turn.
- Meeting deadlines and timelines assures clients and colleagues that they can count on you to get the job done. Without professional punctuality, customers might look for another company to supply their needs. Striving to meet deadlines helps establish your strong work ethic and your desire to be productive.
- Being punctual helps you establish your reputation as a dependable and consistent worker. In an interdependent work environment, everything runs like a well-oiled piece of machinery. Being on time helps ensure that you're doing your best to keep things running smoothly.
