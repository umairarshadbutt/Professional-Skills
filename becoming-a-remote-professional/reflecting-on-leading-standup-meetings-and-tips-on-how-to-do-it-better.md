# Reflecting on leading standup meetings and tips on how to do it better

In the standup meeting, you will take turns leading the meetings. How do you know if you are leading the group meeting well? Here a few questions that you can ask yourself:

### **Facilitating**

Does everyone get a chance to speak at the meeting?

Can team members ask questions if they have any?

Do your team members get unblocked?

### Ensuring meeting stays on topic

Does your meeting often talk about topics that are not related to the daily standup?

Are people directed to take their questions offline if it takes too long to solve the blocker?

### Ensuring the meeting ends on time

Does the meeting often run overtime or do some team members not get a turn to speak?

## Potential challenges

Some factors can impact whether a leader can do their job well. Here are a few examples: 

- A team member is unmotivated and not willing to participate. This student might choose to talk about another topic.
- A team member talks a lot and goes over their time when it's their turn.
- A team member is shy and does not participate.
- Team members aren't volunteering to unblock a student.

## Tips on how to solve them:

Below you will see some examples of challenges and things you can see to help overcome them. A rule of thumb as a leader is to always listen to people and try to comment on what they have to say as opposed to just stating the rules. It helps other team members to be engaged. Be kind and use humor so people feel more eager to listen to you. 

Start the meeting by welcoming everyone and stating the objective of the call to remind everyone why they are here:

*"Hi everyone, so great to see you all! Today we'll take turns stating our achievements of the day and any blockers. Remember, the goal of this call is to celebrate what went well, gain motivation from each other, and unblock anyone if they are stuck."*

Appoint people to talk to if you have any shy people in the group. This will make it easier for them to participate. Remind people of the time limit at the beginning of the meeting:

*"Sarah, you can start today. Remember, we each just have two minutes to share so let's focus on the most important achievements or blockers if you have any."*

If you have a person who is talking about a topic that is not relevant for the meeting, kindly remind them of the priorities of this meeting. Add a small joke or say something that shows that you've listened to what they said so the person still feels heard. Humor helps make things feel lighter and makes it easier for people to listen to you:

*"Carlos, I'd love to hear more about your day because your story sounds so funny, but for right now let's focus on the achievements and blockers because we're so limited in time."*

If someone is not motivated to do the standup and suggests doing something different, remind that person that you feel a need to have the meeting so the person feels a sense of urgency to do it. Add humor when you can:

"*Actually, I've been pretty blocked with something so I've been looking forward to this standup. I'd rather not go another day going crazy looking at my code*" or *"Ah, I understand; sometimes I'm also not in the mood for these standups, but hearing what everyone has been working on always gives me a motivation boost. It's like my remote version of sharing a coffee with the team."*

If people are talking about blockers in the standup meeting that aren't being solved after the meeting, make sure to appoint a person who is responsible for helping to increase the chance of that person being unblocked. If too many members feel responsible, people tend to assume that someone else will take care of it and therefore do not take a:

*"Who volunteers to help Fatima? Ok, if no one volunteers I will randomly select someone. Juan, can you see if you can help unblock Fatima after this call? If you aren't able to solve it, please reach out to the group and I'll appoint another team member who can help you".*

Wrap up the call and remind people of any topics that need to be discussed after the standup:

*"Okay, thanks, everyone! We had a lot to discuss but we managed to stick to the time. Great time-management skills. Fatima, you will follow up with Juan about your blocker after the call. Let us know if you're still not able to solve your blocker."*
