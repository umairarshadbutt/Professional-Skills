# Compass for determining my workplace norm or culture

When you start your new job, use this compass to decipher some of the unspoken workplace norms or cultures and get an idea of how you can adapt to these norms:

- Norms on punctuality:
  - Do the team members show up to the meeting on time? before time? or after time?
  - How do they react when someone shows up late to a meeting? Does the manager get angry? Do they issue a warning?
- Norms on professionalism:
  - Do the team members have their cameras on?
  - Do they mute themselves when they join the meeting?
  - Is anyone smoking, eating, or drinking during the meeting? How is this perceived by management? Do they issue a warning?
  - How is everyone dressed? Are they smart-casual, casual, or in a suit and tie?
- Norms on communication:
  - How do your colleagues write emails? Do they always respectfully start their emails with "Hello"? or "Good morning"?
  - Who do they copy in emails? Do they copy everyone in? Or just the specific team member they are speaking to?
  - What about salary raises? Do they have an annual review meeting where this is discussed? Or is it more informal?
- Norms on communicating about day-to-day work:
  - What about progress? How do they communicate their progress on tasks? Do they do daily stand-ups, weekly check-ins? or 1:1 meetings with the manager every month?.
  - `What about deadlines? How do they respond to not meeting a deadline for a project? Are they okay with a little delay? Or do they get angry and expect it to be delivered on time?
- Norms on personal relationship-building routines:
  - Does this company favor building personal relationships even in this remote setting? Do they have activities like coffee-buddies, donut-chats, or weekly casual Fridays where we come together and have a relaxed virtual chat? Or do they focus only on work getting done?
  - Does this company favor people who are seen and heard? Do they favor people who appear more and speak up more than others? Or do they just focus on whether you are meeting your goals?
- Norms on Paid Time Off (PTO) and sick time:
  - Does this company allow you to take PTO and if so, how often? How many days is too many? or too few? Can you take a whole month off without any issues? What are others doing? Do they have a written PTO policy? And if so, where can you find it?
  - What about sick time off? How many sick days are we allowed to take in a year? Do you need to give notice before taking sick time off? Is there a staff member who you can discuss this with? What are others in the company doing? Is there a written sick time policy? And if so, where can you find it?
- Norms on general behavior:
  - How are people in general on the team? When we are in meetings, are they more casual, smiley, or friendly? Or do they prefer a stricter more professional look?
  - Do team members show respect to each other in meetings? Do they talk over each other in meetings or wait for others to have their turn?
  - In meetings do people multi-task? Or do they listen attentively? Do they get a warning when they multitask during a meeting? Or when they are on their cell phones during a meeting?
  - Do people tend to share personal details like their holidays, hobbies, etc? Or do they prefer to keep this a strict work-only environment?
