## Using project updates to work better as a team

This lesson will talk about the importance and the benefits of project updates to help collaboration go more smoothly in your group project team.

### Why is giving project updates important?

Project updates help group work in the remote setting. As you are not working in the same room you are not able to see the progress of your colleagues, nor any of the blockers they are struggling with. Project updates help give transparency to the whole team where members are in their part of the project and help move you forward as a team.

Project updates are also useful to bring blockers to the surface and let team members know when someone is stuck and needs help. Project updates are an essential part in making sure that work gets done by the deadline. They are a tool for communication, accountability and transparency. You will start using project updates in your first group project and will continue doing so in all group projects in the program.
