Last week you learned about the different roles that exist in group work. This week you will assign roles to the different team members. These roles should not be assigned randomly, but ideally according to your different strengths. The roles below are suggestions and the categories are not arbitrary as people tend to have a mixed profile.

## The different roles:

### Leader/Facilitator

The leader/facilitator role can be best executed by someone with the dominance or influence roles. They are people who are not afraid of speaking to others and focus on getting work done.

### Task-assigner/Kanban board-owner

The task-assigner role can best be performed by someone who scores high on dominance or influence as this person focuses on taking action and can have a good overview of who needs to do what.

### Timekeeper

The timekeeper role can be best performed by someone who scores high on conscientiousness due to their focus on preciseness.

### Monitor

The monitor role can best be fulfilled by someone who scores high on steadiness as it's someone who is focused on cultivating harmony. This person best understands the needs and views of others and can connect people.

### Code review checker

The code checker role can best be done by someone who scores high in conscientiousness as it's someone who focuses on accuracy and follows up to ensure everyone is doing their part of the work.
