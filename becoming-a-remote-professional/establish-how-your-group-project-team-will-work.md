### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will assign the roles between team members and define work agreements as a team to ensure the capstone projects go smoothly. 

### Why is establishing how your group project team will work important?

Teamwork can make the final project better for several reasons; different strengths work on a project, different input and points of view, and better problem solving when multiple people are involved. But group work can be hard as more people are involved, especially when the deadline is short and the stakes are hard! To avoid conflict, it's important to have good agreements and roles defined to make the outcome of the project successful.

### Assigning roles and defining work agreements.

**Guiding questions:**

- What group roles did you feel were most suited for you?
- Did the roles relate to your DiSC profile?
