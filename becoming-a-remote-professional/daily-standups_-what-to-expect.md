# Daily standups: What to expect

## Learning objectives

- Describe the value of the daily standup team.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## What to expect from the daily standup

This lesson will talk about what you can expect during a standup meeting and how to run this meeting effectively. 

### Why is this important?

The evening standup team meeting is a quick 15-minute meeting that comes at the end of your day. The evening meeting is similar to a scrum meeting often held by companies following the Agile methodology. The meeting is not for problem-solving but for celebrating the achievements of each team member and for identifying areas where each person feels blocked. From Monday to Thursday you will discuss each day's events.
