# Establish how your final capstone team will work

## Learning objectives

- Plan a 2+ week project with no interim Microverse-set milestones and submit it on time.
- Independently implement best practices for group agreements to improve teamwork in larger group project.
- Describe types of group roles and summarize their value for making teamwork in group projects a success.

### **Estimated time**: 1.25h

## Description

This lesson will help you prepare the group work for the final capstone. 

### Why is this important?

Soon you will start the final capstone. For this capstone, you will have less guidance from Microverse to set work agreements, define roles, and will need to define the milestones yourself. Given all the previous experience you have with group capstones, you are fully prepared to do the final capstone with less guidance. During this capstone, you will work in a larger group than previous capstones. 

This will prepare you for the workplace where you work as a team on a project and will need to be responsible as a team for the final product; this includes creating the plan of action, collaborating as a team, and ensuring you reach the deadline with success. As a team grows larger collaboration can be more challenging. More teammates mean more diversity, more opinions, and a bigger mix of working styles. Having good working agreements and communication will be key in delivering the final project successfully and on time.
