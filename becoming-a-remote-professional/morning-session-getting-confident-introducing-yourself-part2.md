### Why is getting confident introducing yourself professionally important?

Getting confident in introducing yourself professionally is important to help you communicate with diverse professionals such as co-founders, technical managers, hiring managers, and recruiters while networking, during your job search, in your interviews, and with your new coworkers when you get a job. 

Being able to communicate your skills and achievements clearly to others will increase their attention and make them more inclined to hear what you have to say.
