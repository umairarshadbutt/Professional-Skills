## Learn to ask great questions

This lesson will talk about how to ask great questions and how great questions will contribute to your learning as a software developer. In the exercise you will have the opportunity for guided practice on asking great questions.

### Why is learning to ask great questions important?

As a Microverse student, you have questions every day. As a junior developer in your first job, you will have many, many more. Learning to be a good developer is about learning how to learn, and a crucial element of this is getting good at asking questions and seeking help.

Learning new things can be overwhelming. There is so much that's unknown, and until you have a foundation, it can feel like you have nothing *but* questions. With time it does get easier—you'll see! Getting good at asking questions—and listening to the answers—will speed up your learning process and help you immeasurably throughout your career at Microverse and in future jobs. People say the road to being an expert is 1,000 hours of practice; think of that road as paved with 10,000 questions.
