**Weak example 1:** This photo is fun and full of personality, but because the background is so distracting, it's not the best fit for professional profiles like LinkedIn.

**Weak example 2:** Car selfies are unprofessional, and can make the viewer wonder whether the person was driving at the time the photo was taken.

**Weak example 3:** This photo is nearly perfect, but the background is somewhat distracting. Blurring the background would improve the photo immensely.

# Strong examples

**Strong example 1:** This person is standing against a nice, neutral background; the focus is therefore on the subject.

**Strong example 2:** The background in this photo is blurred, allowing the focus to rest on the subject.

**Strong example 3:** This is another example of a blurred background. The focus is entirely on the subject, making this a strong professional photo.

# How to blur the background of a photo

We recommend that all students take a photo using **option 1** (taking a photo against a neutral background) **or** **option 2** (taking a photo with a camera that has the ability to focus on you). However, we understand that this may not be possible for everyone. If all you have is a photo and a computer, you can use tools like Photoshop or Pixlr (free) to **very carefully** blur the background. Here's a video showing how to use [Pixlr's free web app](https://pixlr.com/e/#editor) to blur the background of a photo.

We used this method to blur one of the photos above. Take a look at the before and after shots.

Blurring the background of a photo manually takes time, effort, and most of all, attention to detail. Blurring the background **badly is worse than not blurring it at all**. If at all possible, we **strongly recommend** choosing Options 1 or 2 instead. This option should only be used if you truly cannot take a new photo.

**Important note: don't try to blur the background until you've verified that your photo meets all of the other requirements of a strong professional profile photo.** If not, you might spend a lot of time trying to perfectly blur your background, only to discover that you needed to choose another photo anyway.
