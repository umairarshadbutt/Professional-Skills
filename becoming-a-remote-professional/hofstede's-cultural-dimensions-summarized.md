# Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions summarized

**Power Distance Index (high versus low).**

This refers to the degree of inequality that exists – and is accepted – between people with and without power. A low PDI score means that power is shared and is widely dispersed, and that society members do not accept situations where power is distributed unequally.

**Individualism Versus Collectivism.**

This refers to the strength of the ties that people have to others within their community. Individualism indicates that there is a greater importance placed on attaining personal goals. Collectivism dimension considers the degree to which societies are integrated into groups and their perceived obligations and dependence on groups.

**Masculinity Versus Femininity.**

This refers to the distribution of roles between men and women. In masculine societies, the roles of men and women overlap less, and men are expected to behave assertively. Demonstrating your success, and being strong and fast, are seen as positive characteristics.

**Uncertainty Avoidance Index (high versus low).**

This dimension describes how well people can cope with anxiety. Countries that score high maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior, and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas. Countries that score low maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles.

**Long- Versus Short-Term Orientation.**

This dimension was originally described as "Pragmatic Versus Normative (PRA)." It refers to the time horizon people in a society display. Countries with a long-term orientation tend to be pragmatic, modest, and more thrifty. In short-term oriented countries, people tend to place more emphasis on principles, consistency, and truth and are typically religious and nationalistic.

**Indulgence Versus Restraint.**

This dimension describes how much a society allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human drives related to enjoying life and having fun. Indulgence stands for a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human drives related to enjoying life and having fun. Restraint stands for a society that suppresses gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms
