## Introduction

In this lesson, we discuss the importance of setting SMART goals as a habit-forming activity that increases your productivity.

### Why is goal-setting important?

Goals help us get work done more efficiently and productively. When you start your day you will be much more effective, productive, and motivated when you have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish.

**A second purpose of goals is to turn big tasks into smaller, more attainable goals.**

The goal of "finishing Microverse" can seem much more overwhelming compared to "finishing the first HTML part of the curriculum."

Bigger, long-term goals, can seem harder and more overwhelming than smaller short-term goals. That is why we ask you to make your goals as small as possible.

So if your goal from your Weekly Retrospective is "Getting started with the React curriculum," you should use your daily goals to break this into smaller tasks and define what you want to achieve per day. So your goal for Monday can be getting through "Basic Data types" as a topic in the curriculum and your goal for Tuesday can be getting through "Variables" as a topic in the curriculum

Setting goals requires you to plan your days and weeks ahead. As a result, it is helpful to always take a moment to look at your upcoming tasks so that you know what is ahead of you in order to plan your days.
