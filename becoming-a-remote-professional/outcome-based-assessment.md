# Outcomes-based assessment

### What is outcome-based education?

The outcome-based approach in education starts with the specification of what the student will be expected to have learned by the end of the program. It's different from traditional education where the teacher decides based on literature, judgment, or other interest what the student should learn. In outcome-based assessment, the learning goals are created based on the desired outcome for the student.

### What does that mean at Microverse?

At Microverse the desired outcome is for Micronauts to have a remote full-stack development job. Therefore each module consists of learning goals that summarize the skills you will need to be hired as a remote software developer. All our lessons, exercises, projects, capstones, and collaboration meetings are designed to give you both the technical skills and the soft skills needed to be hired at the end of our program. 

A core skill a software developer should have is to be able to investigate and problem solve. Therefore at Microverse, we will not hold your hand and solve all your problems for you. You can always reach out to us and we will support you but we expect you to show what you have done to try and solve your problem on your own first. To be successful in the Microverse program, we expect you to show a level of independence from day one. This means taking ownership of your own learning each step of the way—and making sure you gain mastery—so that then when you reach capstone projects you are ready to apply what you have learned and showcase your skills.
