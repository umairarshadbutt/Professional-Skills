# Create the first draft of a professional-looking GitHub profile page

## Learning objectives

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Description

In the project, we'll walk you through how to fill out your GitHub profile in such a way that it's dynamic, professional, and able to immediately catch a hiring manager's attention.

### Why is a strong GitHub profile so important?

Your GitHub profile is like your resume in the software world; it gives hiring managers insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do. You can tell a company that you have skills in React, but if they look at your GitHub and see no React projects, they're not going to believe you. Likewise, you can tell a company that you have good documentation skills,  but if they take a look at your README files and see that they're messy, disorganized, or incomplete, they're not going to give you a chance to prove them wrong.

In other words, it's **vitally important** that you put just as much of an effort into creating a strong GitHub profile as you do into creating strong projects or strong resumes. A solid GitHub profile can be the difference between receiving interview requests and being rejected for positions outright.

However, remember that this is your first draft. Do your best, but know that you will have the opportunity to receive feedback and make further improvements. Stick to the suggested time limits, so that you don't get stuck on any specific area. 

### Project setup

1. Log in to your GitHub account and take 2-3 minutes to familiarize yourself with your profile and your Accounts Setting page.

## Complete your GitHub bio

Your bio—the sidebar section of your GitHub profile, where visitors can see your name, portfolio, job title, etc.—is the easiest part of your GitHub profile to fill out. Because it's so easy, though, many people either skip it over entirely, or skip over some sections they may not find as useful. However, **each section of the bio has a purpose, and hiring managers want to see all of them filled out.**

**Learn more about how to fill out your GitHub bio to completion:**

[Exploring and completing each section of your GitHub bio](exploring-and-completing-each-section-of-your-github-bio.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Open up your GitHub profile and click the **Edit Profile** button located in the left sidebar. 
2. Fill out each section of your GitHub bio. 
3. Double-check your bio against the curriculum to ensure that you have not accidentally skipped a section.

## Fill out your personal README (optional, but recommended)

GitHub allows you to create a personal README file that displays at the top of your GitHub profile above the pinned projects. You can write whatever you want in this field, which allows for even more customization of your GitHub profile. This is a fantastic way to promote your work in a way that can potentially be more prominent than simply linking to your portfolio or pinning your best projects.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. [Create a new, public repository](https://github.com/new) with the same name as your GitHub username. (Note: this is case-sensitive; your README file must match your GitHub username exactly.)
2. Create a README.md file inside the new repo.
3. Complete the README file with your custom content.
4. Commit and push to display your README on your profile.

## Pin strong, diverse projects to showcase your development skills

Your pinned projects are the **first** projects a visitor to your GitHub will ever see. It's therefore **incredibly important** to pin **six complex, sophisticated projects** and **include compelling, detailed project summaries for all six**. Let's talk about how to make sure that your pinned projects impress a recruiter!

**Learn more about how to choose which projects to pin:**

[Carefully curate your list of pinned projects to best showcase your strengths](carefully-curate-your-list-of-pinned-projects-to-best-showcase-your-strengths.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Pin six of your most complex, attractive projects, ensuring that your pinned projects showcase a breadth of technologies.
2. Write detailed, thorough descriptions for each project, including a brief summary of the project, the technologies you used to build it, and 1-2 major features.
3. Ask your peers to star your repos.
4. If needed, use the tutorial in the link above to change the tagged language of the GitHub project.

## Showcase your commitment with your Activity chart

The final element of a strong GitHub profile isn't something that you can complete right now: rather, it's only something that can be done over time.

Your Activity chart is **the quickest way** a recruiter has **to view** **your commitment to development**. Hiring managers and recruiters want to hire developers who actually spend time developing. If you only commit code once a week, then not only will your Microverse progress suffer, but also (and more importantly) a recruiter who visits your GitHub profile might not actually believe that you're a strong developer.

**Learn more about how to showcase your consistency and commitment:**

[Keep your Activity green with small daily commits](keep-your-activity-green-with-small-daily-commits.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you don't already have a dedicated block of time each day for committing to GitHub, create a calendar block and set up a calendar alert to remind you to commit something each day to GitHub.

## Project Submission

### Project Requirements

- [Make sure that your GitHub profile meets every requirement of the GitHub rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1x6Vqm6rmChKkb3T3IXBWRNyygTZ2oiHCPZq4IrXT4/edit). If you have followed the curriculum above, it should do so automatically

### Submission Instructions

1. Use Grammarly and/or copy/paste the text of your profile (including your bio, personal README, and project descriptions) into a Google Doc, in order to double-check for spelling errors and grammatical issues. Identify any errors, then return to your GitHub profile and correct those errors.
2. Verify that all technologies and proper nouns are correctly capitalized (for example, use "JavaScript" instead of "Javascript").
3. Submit a link to your GitHub profile.

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.* 

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your GitHub profile.

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

A note: this is a research paper, and therefore will be more difficult to read than a blog post, but the information included here is very useful. If you view nothing else, view the table on page 4, which contains 5 common "activity traces" that hiring managers and recruiters look for.
