# Introductions for different professionals

During your job search process, you will get to connect with many people playing different roles in an organization. Every time you interact with someone new, introducing yourself is a way to initiate the conversation. 

## Some common things

In all the introductions some aspects will remain the same irrespective of the professional in front of you. 

- **Say hello and say your name:** This is the first step of any introduction message.
- **State your objective:** State the objective of reaching out to the specific professional.
- **How did you get to know about the job opportunity:** Share this in case you are reaching out to the professionals after seeing a job opportunity. In case you are doing a cold call to figure out if a company has a job opening, ignore this part.  ****
- **Call to action:** A call to action (or CTA) is a short statement meant to *encourage the audience to do something valuable for you:* to continue the dialogue, to have a chat on LinkedIn, to meet you over Zoom, to share your application material, to share their email id, etc.

Example: *"I'd love to share my resume with links to the portfolio. Would it be okay for you to share it with the concerned hiring manager?"*

## Aspects that differ with each professional

Apart from the above-mentioned common aspects, every professional because of their role is inclined to hear a specific thing over the other. 

- **HR manager:** HR managers are generally more focused on knowing about your **past experiences, soft skills, and why you are interested in working at the mentioned company**.
- **Engineer:** Engineers would be more interested to know about some **technical projects** that you have worked on and how the work on those projects would be helpful in the role that you want to apply for.
- **Potential** **team member:** With a potential team member you can share your **present work** and **technical skills** that you have learned.
- **Founder:** A founder would be keen on hearing your **goal, your excitement and pride about the goal**, and how the **role that are you applying for fits in with your goal**.
