What are morning sessions at Microverse.

## Description

Each morning you will start the day at Microverse with your Morning Session Group for 30 minutes. Some sessions will be focused on learning, some will be focused on coding through mob programming or peer-to-peer reviews.

### Why are Morning Sessions important?

The Morning Sessions allow you to learn important skills related to software development. Mob programming and peer-to-peer code reviews are very common in the tech environment. Practicing these skills on a weekly basis will allow you be experts in this by the time you apply for your dream job. At the same time, two sessions a week will focus on helping you develop the professional skills required to land (and keep) an exceptional job.

Morning Session Groups consist of 3-4 students and change weekly. They change often so that you are always with other students who are in the same study week as you. Morning Session Groups are within cohort, so you'll soon begin knowing one another quite well.
