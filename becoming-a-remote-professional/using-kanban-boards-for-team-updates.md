# Using Kanban boards for team updates

At Microverse and later in the workplace you will use kanban boards so other team members can understand how your work is going. Below are a set of steps you can use so your team updates always go well.

### **Step 1: Read through all your cards and make sure you understand what is required for each task.**

Some tasks seem straightforward when you read the card, but once you start working on it you may suddenly realize that you don't fully understand the expectations or you aren't sure about the next steps to take. Always read through all your cards and identify the first three steps to take. This is especially important for the remote environment, where getting answers and feedback might take time. Therefore you want to ask all your questions at the beginning of the week while you can go ahead and get started on a task where you do not have questions. This way, you avoid wasting time while waiting around to get an answer to your question.

Reading through all your cards will also allow you to identify tasks where you require help or the work from another person. You can plan with the team member on when you will work together, get feedback or get help from that person.

Finally, you must be familiar with your cards so that you can answer questions on the next steps for a card during a team meeting. This is especially important in the workplace, where your manager will ask questions about your approach or next steps on a task to better understand the work process and to see if you need any assistance.

### **Step 2: Keep your board up-to-date so it reflects the latest status of all your work.**

Your board should always be updated so it reflects the current state of work. If you're working on something, but you are stuck for multiple days, move the task back from "In Progress" to "This Sprint". Move tasks to "Done" when they are finished with being reviewed and do not require more actions.

Boards that are not updated might give the false impression that blockers on the team level are present or might hide any blockers. For example; how will the team know a problem with reviewing tasks is occurring if the "In Review" status has both finished and unfinished tasks?

### **Step 3: Communicate about In Progress**

Be ready to talk about what task you currently have "In Progress" and what you have left to finish for that task. Ideally, you will have no more than one task "In Progress" at a time as you should aim to finish a task before starting a new task to avoid multitasking.

### **Step 4: Communicate about In Review**

Be able to talk about the tasks "In Review", who it will be reviewed by, and by when it is expected to be reviewed.

### **Step 5: Communicate about Watching**

This column is for tasks that are in the testing phase. It's titled "Watching" before you generally will watch it for a few days to see if what you created works. After this phase, you will either move it back to "In Progress" if changes are required or to "Done" if it is working well. Be able to talk about the tasks "Watching", how long it needs to be "Watching" and what it will take to get it moved to Done.

### **Step 6: Problem-solving**

Certain problems can show up through a kanban board. Here are a few examples:

- You are halfway through the week, but you still have most tasks in "Prioritized."

This means you might be stuck on a task or a task was scoped wrongly and requires more time than planned. Reach out to others to ask for help either to unblock you or to make sure that you aren't overcomplicating the tasks causing it to require more time than planned.

- You have too many tasks "In Progress."

Aim to work on one task and finish it before moving on to a new task to avoid multitasking. Our brain loses focus and attention when we work on many things at once which increases time spent on the task and increases the chance of errors. Focus on what tasks are the priority and move other tasks back to "This Sprint".

- You have too many tasks in "In Review" which means that someone else is blocking you.

Assess who is responsible for reviewing your tasks and what is blocking them. Discuss by when they can review your tasks and appoint a new reviewer if needed.
