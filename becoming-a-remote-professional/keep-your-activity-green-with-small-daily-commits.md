# Keep your Activity green with small daily commits

Over the next several months, try to commit code to your GitHub profile at least **five days a week**. You might occasionally take a weekday day or two off for vacation or relaxation, and that's fine! But for the most part, the last few months of your GitHub Activity chart should show nearly entirely green.

It is very important to **keep your GitHub profile looking active** after you finish building it and it is approved by a project reviewer. Doing this may seem difficult given how many other things you're busy with, but it can be done if you pick a project to work on every day and do small chunks of work on it. Remember: You don't necessarily need to implement a whole feature or fix a whole bug to get activity on your GitHub profile. Filing issues against your project or adding an automated test is often enough. [Have a look at this video for a real world example](https://www.loom.com/share/97f5fba2a94445cd8f6eaac70cc987ef?t=0)!

**Reminder:** make sure that your "Private contributions" checkbox is checked on. You should have done this in the previous step, but if not, do so now.

For reference, this is what you want your GitHub profile to look like!

It will take time to build your Activity chart. Just continue working every day, and soon your Activity chart will look as green (or even greener) than the one above!
