### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn the importance of having roles when working in a team and the different types of roles that exist in software development teams. 

### Why is learning about roles for larger group work important?

Next week, you will be working on a large project with a group of 4-5 people. For the project to be successful, it is not enough to produce code. There has to be cohesion amongst team members: 

- Each person needs to know who is doing what;
- Tasks have to be organized and monitored;
- Communication issues have to be dealt with on time, and so on.

Having roles in your team will help prevent and deal with conflicts that can come up, thus ensuring a smooth project advancement and happy team members.

### Why is group work beneficial?

You might wonder "*Why do I need to work with other people in a group when I can complete this project on my own?*". The benefits of group work are numerous and go beyond completing the project. Working in a group allows you to learn more about yourself, your strengths, and the strengths of others. It teaches you patience, people management, time management, the ability to listen to others, and the ability to make decisions for the success of the project and the wellbeing of the team. It also teaches you accountability and productivity. When done properly, working in a team can also give you the sensation of team accomplishment.

The following video below shows you the 7 main benefits of teamwork. Make sure you pause the video as you watch it, taking a minute to read through each benefit so you fully understand why it is important to work in a team.

### Tips to working successfully in large groups
