- Use daily team updates to identify and overcome project blockers.
- Support teammates and team progress through daily updates and discussion of blockers.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

This lesson will prepare you for your first asynchronous project update with your group and will help you understand what needs to be included in these daily updates. 

### Why are daily project updates important?

Daily project updates are important in the remote learning environment. They are also a common practice in both remote and non-remote tech teams. They allow each team member to be up-to-date on the work that each individual is working on. Project updates also ensure that blockers are solved before it's too late. For project updates to be effective, team members must take a few minutes to reflect and prepare for their project update so that they communicate everything that is needed to their team.

### What should the daily project update include?

Below we will go through the different questions and what each answer should include.

### *Overall mood:* green, yellow, red

This question refers to your general mood. It's important to tell your team how you're feeling about the work because it helps them to quickly know if you are really stuck and needing help. When you choose a color, you want to take into account your stress levels, time need, and ability to work on your tasks without getting blocked. 

- Green means things are going smoothly and you are on target.
- Orange means that things aren't going so well. You feel more stressed than usual, you feel rushed, or you are running into a lot of difficulties.
- Yellow might mean things can turn red soon, but can also be fixed soon.
- Red means you are completely blocked, very stressed or you have too many tasks to do and someone needs to take action by either unblocking you or taking over tasks.

### *What have you worked on since the last update?*

Here you should include all the tasks that you have finished or are currently in the process of completing since the last update. If this is the first update, then include everything you have worked on of that day.

### *What will you work on next?*

What do you plan to work on until the next update? This should be a list of tasks you plan on working on until the next project update.

### *Are you worried about finishing your part of the work in time for the team deadline? Answer Yes, No, or Somewhat and explain why (if needed).*

Here you should let your team know if you feel worried about not being able to finish your part as planned. You must communicate this as soon as possible. The rule of thumb is to communicate early or overcommunicate whenever you can.

In some cases, you might communicate when you only feel somewhat worried. For example, if your task took more time than expected on a given day, you might communicate this to your team even though you will likely be able to catch up on the work the next day. In this case, you might write the following:

*Somewhat*.Â *Today I spent much more time on milestone 3 than expected. I managed to finish it but this means I'm delayed with the next task. I plan to catch up tomorrow but I will let you know in the update tomorrow if I managed to succeed.*

This will allow your teammates to prepare in case someone needs to step in and help on the following day. It is usually better to share too much information than not enough.

### *Do you need help or have questions for your teammates?*

Let your teammates know if you have any questions or if you need help. It's always better to ask your questions immediately and not wait another day. Your teammates prefer that you reach out for help instead of not saying anything and not being able to move forward. Remember to not only ask questions but also help other teammates whenever you can. You're more likely to receive help when you help others too!
