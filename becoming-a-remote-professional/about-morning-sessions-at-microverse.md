# About morning sessions at Microverse

Morning sessions are always done with your morning session group. These groups have 3-4 students who are all in the same block. Your morning session group changes every block, and since most blocks last one week, this means your morning session group changes every week throughout most of the program. This allows you to get acquainted with students who have different backgrounds, communication styles, and learning paces than you do, all of whom are at the exact same place in the curriculum as you.

Your morning session activities at Microverse will consist of two types of activities: professional skills morning sessions and technical skill morning sessions. At the beginning of each week, you will choose a presenter for your group.

### Professional skills morning sessions

Professional skills morning sessions happen all through Week 1 of the program, and then on Monday and Wednesday thereafter. During professional skills morning sessions you will work on soft skills that will help you land and keep a software development job. For example:

- Giving and receiving feedback.
- Dealing with imposter syndrome.
- Cross-cultural collaboration.
- And many more topics important to your professional development.

### Technical skills morning sessions

Technical skills morning sessions happen on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays starting in Week 2 of the program. During technical skills morning sessions, you will do peer-to-peer code reviews or mob programming. During a peer-to-peer code review, one team member, the presenter, will present their latest pull request with commits while other team members review the code. Later in the program, you will do mob programming, where the presenter solves a coding challenge while explaining out loud to the team how they are going to solve it.

Both of these tasks allow you to get valuable feedback about your code and allow you to present your thinking process and knowledge of algorithms and data structures in a live meeting- something you'll frequently have to do during job interviews and in a software development job.

### How to select a presenter for the morning session

The presenter changes each day and everyone must get a chance to present regularly. You will assign a presenter when everyone arrives in the call before starting the session. Each day a person should volunteer to be the presenter. Each member should be the presenter atleast once a week. Make sure that you switch between leading technical and professional morning session so you become acquinted with both. If you are unable to decide who should be the presenter, you can use the sorting hat in Slack to randomly select a presenter. To ask the Sorting Hat, run the /sorting_hat command in your Morning Session Group Slack channel.

### What does the presenter do in morning sessions?

- Open the meeting by welcoming everybody and explaining the activity of the day.
- Present their latest pull request or solve a coding challenge if it's a technical skill morning session.
- Lead the activity discussions by asking the right questions and making sure everybody participates in the discussion if it's a professional skill morning session.
- Keep feedback discussions positive and constructive.
- Keep the meeting professional and respectful.
- Help the team build rapport and get to know one another.

### What do the participants do in the morning sessions?

- Participate in the activity.
- Ask questions.
- Help the presenter if needed.
- Give constructive feedback.
