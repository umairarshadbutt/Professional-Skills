# Three habits for success 

Remote work has many benefits, such as improved work-life balance and the ability to hire talent from all around the world. However, remote work also comes with a very specific set of challenges. For example, as we are working from our homes, we may be more exposed to interruptions. Also, we might want to continue working after Program hours which may increase our risk for burn-out.

To limit the challenges of remote work and increase the benefits, it's important to adopt a set of strategies to set yourself up for success.

### 1) Understand and get ready for deadlines

- Start by understanding what deadlines are due on which days.
- Start early. Projects may be harder as they first seem so plan for extra time needed. Account for extra time to get reviews from Code Reviewers as they can take up to 24 hours. Don't leave finishing your projects until right before the deadline!

### 2) Be present or communicate early

- Be present and collaborate with your teams every day to make sure that you are keeping momentum in the Program and can reach your deadlines.
- If you will be absent unexpectedly due to sickness or for other reasons, make sure you notify your partner on time so you can make agreements on how to move forward so this does not impact either of your ability to make the deadline.

### 3) Prepare for your new schedule

- Prepare your weekly schedule including outside Program requirements:
  - Make sure you are consistently following the Microverse Daily Schedule. 
  - Limit distractions! Put your phone away while you are working, close Youtube tabs or tabs related to blogs, and make sure you are in a quiet environment. Think of other distractions that you might have and try to limit them as much as possible.
  - Take breaks to help you recharge and set you up for long-term success. You might find yourself wanting to continue working during lunch breaks to get through the material faster, but over time that may limit your ability to learn. We need to take breaks to help us focus and learn new concepts.
  - Plan when you will take care of other responsibilities, hobbies or sports outside of the Program so they don't take time away from the Program.
- Communicate with your family members, partner or housemates about your new schedule:
  - Try to help them understand that during the Program hours you cannot be distracted or interrupted at home as you are focused on learning.
  - Communicate clearly with them about your ability to do chores, prepare food or transport family members only outside the Program hours.
  - Help them understand that your studies are the beginning of new habits you will have in your remote career.
