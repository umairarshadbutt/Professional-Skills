### Why is getting confident introducing yourself professionally important?

Getting confident in introducing yourself professionally is important to help you communicate with diverse professionals such as co-founders, technical managers, hiring managers, and recruiters while networking, during your job search, in your interviews, and with your new coworkers when you get a job. 

Being able to communicate your skills and achievements clearly to others will increase their attention and make them more inclined to hear what you have to say. 

### What does a confident introduction consist of?

**Guiding questions:**

- What are some characteristics that you see in a confident introduction?

While looking for jobs we have to interact with different types of professionals. An introduction done with clarity and confidence leaves a solid first impression.

### How does your introduction differs with different professionals?

**Guiding questions:**

- Do you have the same personal introduction for all the professionals you interact with?
- If not, how does it differ with each professional?

In the lesson about _"[Introducing yourself professionally](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/communicating-in-english/introducing-yourself-professionally-in-english.md)"_, you learned about creating a structure for introducing yourself. Refresh your memory by referring to the structure that you created for yourself. You will use parts of your responses from the structure depending on who is in front of you.
