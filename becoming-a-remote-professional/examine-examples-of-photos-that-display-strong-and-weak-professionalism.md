# **Examine examples of photos that display strong and weak professionalism**

Before taking or selecting a photo, you must first make sure that you'll meet these requirements:

- **Do** make sure your hair (including facial hair) is brushed and neat.
- **Do** choose an outfit that looks tidy and work-appropriate (no pajamas, wrinkled shirts, etc.).
- **Don't** use "mirror selfies;" we shouldn't be able to see the camera or smartphone in the photo.
- **Don't** wear a shirt with logos or words on it; the focus should be on your face, not on your clothes.
- **Don't** wear a shirt the same color as your background. ****Doing so will make it seem as if your head is floating in an empty space.
- **Don't** wear **long-sleeved orange shirts.** In many Western cultures, long-sleeved orange shirts are a common prison uniform. To prevent this negative association, avoid them.
- **Don't** wear hats, bandanas, or other "casual" head coverings. Religious head coverings, of course, are perfectly fine!
- **Don't** wear sunglasses, goggles, or anything that may cover your face.

**Weak example 1:** Avoid mirror selfies and casual head coverings like bandanas. Both appear overly casual and are not a good fit for professional profiles like LinkedIn.

**Weak example 2:** Avoid wearing sunglasses or shirts with words/logos on them; the focus should be on your face.

**Weak example 3:** This person's outfit doesn't seem work appropriate. The background also looks like a bed, which isn't a good fit for a professional photo.

**Strong example 1:** This person is wearing a nice suit and tie, and their appearance is professional and tidy.

**Strong example 2:** This person is wearing a blazer, and they look well-groomed and professional.

**Strong example 3:** This person is wearing a nice shirt, and their overall appearance is tidy, professional, and work-appropriate.

The focus of your photo should not be your outfit; it should be your face. If your outfit is distracting (either because it's unprofessional or because it draws attention away from your face for any reason), you should replace your outfit or choose another photo.
