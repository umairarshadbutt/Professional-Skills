# Project updates at Microverse 

### How to use daily project updates?

The first and foremost purpose of project updates is to let your team know the status is of your task. Project updates will make sure that there is transparency in the team and there are no surprises of unfinished tasks by the end of the week.

Project updates will help you as an individual because they push you to think and plan: What will I be working on by the next update? What blockers might I experience tomorrow?

Project updates will also make sure that you are not stuck and waiting and ensures that you can ask other team members to unblock you.

### How to give a good update?

Each day you should give a project update to your team at an agreed-upon time. Your project update shouldn't just be a list of things that you have done, but rather should give your team more context about the task. In your update, talk about challenges you had with completing certain tasks or aspects that went surprisingly smooth.

- What have you done since the last update?
- What are you doing now until the next update?
- Do you need help from someone else on the team? Do you have any questions? Are you blocked in some way? Be sure to tag relevant people in your response.

### Where will I give my project updates?
You will receive a reminder in your group project team's Slack channel, and you should put your project updates there.
