# Build a personal README file that displays both personality and competence

## What to include in your personal README?

Your personal README should be professional but fun, and should showcase a little bit of your personality along with your knowledge/projects. There's no single method to creating a great README, but here are a few suggestions:

- Create an "About me" section, listing technologies you work with, technology-related topics you're interested in, and some personal information such as likes or dislikes. You can do this with bullet points, or with a code snippet. Take a look [at this awesome example from a Microverse student](https://github.com/misselliev)!
- Link to projects you've worked on that are not hosted on GitHub (and include attractive screenshots).
- [Use Canva to create a professional banner](https://www.canva.com/create/banners/).
- Display live updating statistics about your contributions to projects on GitHub.
- Add links or contact information (such as an e-mail address, LinkedIn/AngelList buttons, etc).
- Mention that you're currently on the lookout for new opportunities

As a general rule of thumb, your personal README can be about **80% development-related, and 20% personal** (as long as it's work-appropriate). You can use emojis or gifs, but limit them (no more than one per bullet point).

## Take a look at examples of fantastic personal READMEs

The best way to create a great personal README is to see what other people have done!

- Here are [10 standout GitHub profile READMEs](https://dev.to/github/10-standout-github-profile-readmes-h2o) (there are a lot of **creative ideas** here)
- Here's [a GitHub repo full of great example profile READMEs](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) to browse through.
- If you're looking for even more ideas, possibly check out [3 ways to spice up your GitHub Profile README](https://dev.to/jayehernandez/3-ways-to-spice-up-your-github-profile-readme-1276).

Again, the personal README is optional, but is **highly recommended**. It may require a small investment in time, but it's a quick, fun way to immediately catch a hiring manager's eye by showing them who you are and what you're capable of.
