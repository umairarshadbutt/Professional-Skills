# Exploring and completing each section of your GitHub bio

## Fields in your GitHub bio

### Profile photo

The profile photo is one of the first impressions a hiring manager will ever have of you; no matter how talented a software developer you are, if your photo is wildly unprofessional, a recruiter or hiring manager will probably immediately exit out of your GitHub profile. Later in the Professional Curriculum, you'll receive a whole lesson on taking or choosing a professional photo. For now, choose a photo that meets the criteria below.

A good profile photo is:

- **High-quality**. The resolution should be crisp and clear. Don't use a blurry image!
- **Well-oriented to focus on your face**. Don't use a full-body photo. Your photo should be shoulders-up.
- **Brightly-lit**. Choose a photo that looks bright. If your photo is dim, use an image editor like [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/x/) to [brighten it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27lXATZyFlE).
- **Friendly.** Don't choose a photo where you look angry or serious; pick one where you're smiling.
- **Professional**. Make sure your clothes and hair are neat and tidy. You don't have to wear a suit, but don't wear pajamas, either.
- **Focus on you, not family or friends.** No group photos :)

### Name

Fill in your **first and last name, or** your **preferred name and last name**. If you have privacy concerns, you can also use your first name and last initial. 

### Bio

A good bio field should be 2-3 sentences of jam-packed information, and should contain the following information:

- Your **job title** (such as Software Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, Back-End Developer, etc.)
- Your **preferred stack** (major languages/frameworks. Don't include HTML/CSS)
- (Optional but preferred) A short sentence **about you**
- A note saying that **currently looking for new opportunities**

Here's an example of a strong bio:

*"Full-Stack Software Developer with a love for React and Redux. I play chess and mess around with state machines in my spare time. Open to new opportunities."*

**Note:** you don't necessarily need to use complete sentences. Here's another example of a good bio that doesn't use full sentences but still manages to communicate relevant information:

*"Software developer, Rails enthusiast, part-time guitarist. Stack: JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React, Redux. Looking for my next job!"*

### Company

If you're currently working part-time as a software developer a company, you may fill in the company's name in this section (note: this will probably not apply to most Microverse students). Otherwise, fill this section with your job title, such as **Full-Stack Developer, Software Engineer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer**.

### Location

List your **country**. If you'd like, you may also give more detailed location information, such as your city or state. Do **not** fill this section with your full street address.

### Email

Fill in your **professional email address**. Your email address will not be visible to anyone who doesn't have a GitHub account.

If you don't see an email field in your sidebar profile, your email settings may be set to private. Visit the [Email Settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) section of your profile and make sure the box is not checked.

### Website

The purpose of the website field is to allow visitors to your profile to learn more about you as a software developer. Please fill it with one of these three possibilities:

- Your portfolio (**preferred**; if you have a portfolio, use your portfolio).
- Your LinkedIn profile (only use if you don't have a portfolio yet)
- Your AngelList profile (only use if you don't have a portfolio yet)

Note: if you use your LinkedIn or AngelList URL because you don't have a portfolio yet, set a reminder right now to update the website field with your portfolio link **as soon as you create it.**

## **Other important fields**

### Include private contributions in your Activity Chart

GitHub allows you to make private contributions, but even if you choose to keep contributions private it's important to still make sure that the activity shows up in your Activity Chart. You can do this **either** by visiting your [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and **checking the box to include your private contributions in the profile** **or** by clicking the Contribution Settings dropdown above your Activity Chart and **clicking Private Contributions**. See the images below for illustrations.

Note that this will **not** make your private projects public. It will merely show that you were coding on a private project that day and help keep your profile looking active.

## Jobs profile

In the "Jobs Profile" field of your [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile), check the box to set yourself available for hire. This will allow you to see jobs posted on GitHub on your dashboard. View the image below for an illustration.

You've now completed your GitHub bio. There are still several sections to complete, though, so continue reading this lesson for more information.
