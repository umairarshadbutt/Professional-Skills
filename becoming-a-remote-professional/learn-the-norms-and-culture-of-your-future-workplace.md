### Why is learning the norms and culture of a remote workplace important?

Technical skills are important to land a job and to do it every day, but they are not sufficient to keep your job. Being a good cultural fit with your colleagues and your company is extremely important in helping you show up professionally in a manner that your company appreciates. The only way to be a good cultural fit is to learn the culture and norms of your workplace.

### What are workplace norms or cultures?

**Guiding questions:**

- Why do companies have norms?
- What types of norms are there?

Workplace norms or cultures are commonly known as ground rules which revolve around how members of a company will interact, communicate, and conduct themselves as team members. Norms help teams agree on how they'd like to get along before situations emerge that might otherwise prevent them from getting along. Norms also help teams remain civil, professional, and productive. There are two types of norms in the workplace: spoken and unspoken norms.

### Compass for determining my workplace norm or culture

**Guiding questions:**

- Does every company follow the same norms?
- How will I know the norm of a workplace if I am not told anything about it when I join the company?

Imagine now that you have gotten your dream job, you are super excited, and you attend your first meeting. You notice that everybody is dressed smartly and has their camera on, but you just woke up and you have your pajamas on so you turn off your camera. You might think "*oh it's okay, they will understand that my time zone is different and I just woke up," b*ut this is not always the case. Your company might have an unspoken norm that everybody should look professional and have their cameras on at meetings. Not abiding by this norm can heavily affect your reputation and evolution in the company.

Since every company is different, every company will have a different set of norms. Because of this diversity, it can be difficult for you to know how to respect the norms, especially when you have just started your job. To help you with this, we have created a compass to help you determine your workplace norms and cultures. As you interact with your colleagues, managers, and as you attend meetings, analyze each item of the compass and use it to figure out the unspoken norms in your workspace.
