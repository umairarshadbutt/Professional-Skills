# Different roles in larger group work

## **Leader/Facilitator**

The leader/facilitator is the person who ensures the group work goes smoothly. They are the ones who will make sure that the team is communicating with each other. They are the ones who will lead the meetings by checking in on everyone to find out how they are doing, then proceed to get a status update from each team member on what tasks have been done, what still needs to be done, how much time they think they will need to complete the task, and if anyone is struggling with a task or an issue and how they can be helped.

**Key tasks of the leader/facilitator:** 

* Keep the group on track and oriented towards its goals to meet team deadlines.
* Look at the team's Kanban board to help the group make sure they are keeping track of every tasks' status update.
* Bring up problems with progress in the team meeting and brainstorm with the team what to do to solve this.
* Make sure **all team members** are as involved as possible in meetings and in brainstorming solutions when issues come up.

## **Task-assigner/ Kanban board-owner**

The task-assigner is the person who assigns tasks to each team member by working with others on the team to determine who does what.

**Key tasks of the task-assigner:**

- Listen to each team member's preferences as to what they want to work on and where their strengths lie.
- Once team members agree on the tasks they want to work on, the task-assigner adds these to the Kanban board with the name of the person attached to that task.
- If there is a conflict on who wants to do what, then the task assigner decides how to handle it (for example, having the whole team can proceed to do a vote, or brainstorming a compromise that works best for the progress of the team).
- Keeps the Kanban board up-to-date and re-assigns cards when needed. 

## **Timekeeper**

The timekeeper is the person who keeps track of time to ensure the team doesn’t miss any deadlines and during meetings to avoid spending excessive time on one topic.

**Key tasks of the timekeeper:**

- Decide with the leader/facilitator before each meeting on how much time to allocate to each issue on the agenda.
- Let everyone know when this time is almost up for each section of the meeting so that issues can be wrapped up appropriately. A good way to do this could be writing "5 mins left for this section" in the chat of your zoom call so everyone is aware and can start wrapping up with action points and solutions.
- Keeps track of deadlines and follows up with teammates if someone is running behind to understand what is happening. 


## **Monitor**

The monitor is also known as the mediator or the arbitrator. The monitor is the person who aims to look after the well-being of the team. They strive to maintain peace and harmony in the team as positive environments contribute to more motivation and more productivity. 

**Key tasks of the monitor:**

- Carefully observe the group's functioning in meetings and intervene, especially if there is a sense of tension or conflict brewing.
- During disagreements or conflicts, clarify the arguments by talking about the facts rather than turning to blame, and then propose suggestions for resolving disputes. If they do not have any suggestions, the group should brainstorm solutions together on how to help harmony of the group.
- Ensure that all group members have a chance to participate and learn by watching carefully for participants who are dominating the conversation and kindly asking them to leave some room for others to share their ideas.
- Watch out for team members who might be struggling to voice their opinion and ask them if they would like to share anything.
- Act as a cheerleader for the group whenever possible, praising team members for work well done, no matter how big or small.

## **Code review checker**

The code checker is the person who monitors the “In review” column of the kanban board.

**Key tasks of the code checker:**

- Make sure that nobody waits for a review longer than necessary.
- Follow up with teammates who haven’t performed a code review yet.
