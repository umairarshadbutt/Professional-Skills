# Setting up a professional remote work environment

As a remote work professional, it is important that you keep an eye on your professionalism. Making sure that you stay professional not only improves your productivity, but dispels any misconceptions employers may have about remote work. When you don't have to worry about lack of trust from an employer or colleague, you can deliver your tasks much easier and have a productive working relationship.

The steps to take in creating a professional working environment can range from the way you present yourself to your workspace. Here are practical ways to improve your remote work environment.

## **Look Professional Online**

Putting forth a professional appearance is very important at Microverse and beyond. Not only does it help create a positive learning experience for your peers, but it also helps you practice for any future job where you need to present yourself online.

Why is it important to look professional at Microverse? As a remote coding school whose goal is to get you a job, Microverse is dedicated to preparing students for success. This means helping you learn to pay attention not only to your lines of code but to how you present yourself professionally. Though it may feel like different standards apply when you're a student, we see it differently. Each interaction you have online at Microverse—and especially those that are part of a larger group interaction such as a Student Assembly—is practice for when it really matters in interviews and in a remote job.

Presenting yourself professionally online involves taking care with:

1. Making a good visual impression
2. Creating a workplace

**Make a good visual impression**

To some, it may seem obvious to create a professional appearance for their day-to-day studies at Microverse. To others, Microverse may feel like an informal school where students go to learn, not be a professional. Since most Microverse students study from their own homes, it can feel like different rules apply than in a workplace or even an in-person classroom. But we believe appearances are important no matter where you work every day. Small details make a big difference in how we make an impression on others, especially over video conferences. We are not suggesting you curate your appearances like a professional video producer or TV interviewer. Instead, we want you to learn about the small ways you can appear more professional and prepared so that you stand out in a good way when working online.

***\*Create a workspace.\****

If possible, it is best to set aside a separate space in your home for work. This will help you separate your home and work activities, and boost productivity when you’re working in your designated space. Communicate with your friends, roommates that even though you are at home, you are off-limits during your scheduled work hours.

Video technology is also an incredible tool to leverage when working remotely. It helps us to stay connected even when we are very far apart. To optimize your video meetings, you should:

- Test out your computer microphone, speakers and camera before important meetings to make sure they work.
- Be conscious of your physical background when in meetings, change to something more professional when needed.
- Use your video camera whenever possible—keeping your camera on can improve understanding and communication.
