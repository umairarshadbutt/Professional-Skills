# How to time-box your activities

Time-boxing means that before starting a task you will define how much time you need for that task. After you reached the previously set time, you finish the task even if you are not done. Don't worry about not getting the amount of time right when you first start. You will become better at estimating time as you have more experience with it.

While studying, time-box this or follow the time-estimates. This is important because you can very easily get lost in studying instead of starting to work on the Projects. Prioritize what you need to understand well before getting started on a project.

Other tips:

- Be aware of moments where you procrastinate or get distracted.
  - Procrastination has less to do with laziness, but more to do with low confidence and lack of belief that you can do the task. When you aren't sure you can complete the task, you will be more likely to find a distraction.
  - Make Progress every day:
    - If you're having a difficult day, work on something easier. By submitting or making progress on something you create a feeling of success and keep momentum.
