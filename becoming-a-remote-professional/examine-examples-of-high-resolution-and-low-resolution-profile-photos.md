# Examine examples of high-resolution and low-resolution profile photos

Resolution is one of the most important aspects of a strong professional photo. Keep these tips in mind when choosing or taking a picture.

- Do **not** use photos smaller than 400x400 pixels; LinkedIn's recommended photo size is a **minimum** of 400x400 pixels. If you use a smaller photo, it may be stretched out and expanded, resulting in a blurry or grainy appearance.
- If you're taking the photo yourself, take multiple versions of the same photo and choose the one that appears most crisp and clear.
- If you are taking the photo yourself, set the camera against a solid surface where it won't move, and then use your camera's or smartphone's timer feature to take the photo while you get back into position.
- **Do not** try to edit a very blurry image. The "Sharpen" tool on Pixlr can be used to help increase crispness, but it will not be able to turn a very blurry image into a high-quality one. If you do not have any high-quality images, you will need to take another one.
- If your large image is still a little blurry, resize it to make it smaller. Resizing your image will increase the number of pixels per inch, thus improving image quality. To resize an image on Pixlr, click **Image > Resize Image**, and then decrease the size. Make sure that "constrain proportions" is checked. **Do not resize it smaller than 400x400.**

All of the photos above are blurry, and the last photo also seems somewhat pixelated, as if the user tried to use the "Sharpen" tool to help increase the quality (to poor effect).

All of these examples are crisp and high-quality; the individuals can be clearly seen, and there is no blurriness to distract from their photos.
