# Overcoming procrastination part 1

## Learning objectives

- Understand the reasons for procrastination and how to overcome it and stay productive with SMART goals.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.*

**Spend 2 minutes reading this section individually.**

How often do you know you have to do something but just don't feel like doing it? This is called procrastination and it is a common feeling we all share as humans. In this exercise, you will gain a thorough understanding of procrastination so you become more aware of it and learn how to overcome it. Techniques for using SMART goals are covered in part 2 of this activity, which you will do later in the week.

### Why is overcoming procrastination important?

Procrastination when not controlled can make us lose control of our goals, dreams, and objectives. It is very similar to driving a car without brakes; the car is bound to have an accident. Procrastination can stop you from achieving the things you set out to do, leaving you with feelings of guilt, under-achievement, frustration, and an inability to have control over your own life. This is why it is important to understand procrastination and overcome it.
