# What is the role of the leader in this meeting? 

The leader has three main tasks: facilitating, ensuring the meeting stays on topic, and ensuring the meeting ends on time.

### How can the leader do this?

- The leader can **facilitate** by reminding the group of the purpose of the meeting and by assigning people to take turns to speak.
- The leader can **ensure the meeting stays on the topic** by reminding the group when the conversation goes off-topic. If someone starts talking about a topic that should take place outside the standup meeting the facilitator can say "that sounds like a discussion we can move to Slack" or if something is brought up that isn't relevant to the meeting they can say "let's remember the purpose of the standup meeting given we are short on time".
- The leader can **ensure the meeting ends on time** by reminding everyone how long they can talk in the beginning. The facilitator can say for example: "Let's start by taking turns, remember, everyone has two minutes to talk about their achievements and blockers". If someone takes too much time the facilitator can gently remind the group of the time by saying "I kindly remind everyone to stick to the two minutes".
