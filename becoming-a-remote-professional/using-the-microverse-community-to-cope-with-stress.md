# Using the Microverse Community to cope with stress 

The journey to becoming a software developer can be a challenging one. Learning new concepts, adjusting to weekly deadlines, and working with many different types of people all feel very new to many Micronauts. All of these are important experiences that will help shape you to become a world-class developer. But from time to time, they might make you feel stressed. Experiencing stress is very common, but experiencing too much stress or experiencing it over an extended period can be harmful.

Let's talk about two important ways to deal with stress.

### **Share with your Standup team and/or Morning Session Group**

Don't be afraid to show vulnerability and be honest with your classmates. You'll see that likely your Standup Team and Morning Session Group members have experienced something similar. This can help with normalizing your feelings and feeling less isolated. In turn, you can discuss strategies that you've used to cope with this stress. Here are some examples of things you might ask your Stand Up team or Morning Session Group:

- This part of the project seems too hard for my abilities. Have anyone else felt that way in the Program? How did you overcome it?
- Today I didn't manage to reach my goals. It feels as though I lost my motivation, do you ever have days like that? How did you overcome it?
- I'm stuck on a specific part of the capstone, it's giving me a lot of stress and I'm worried about not reaching the deadline. Have you ever felt that?

### **Share with your mentor**

Reach out to your mentor about how you feel. Your mentor has more experience in the Program and will be able to tell you if what you feel is normal. Mentors can share more about their experiences and how they dealt with stress. Mentors will also be able to help guide you in finding ways to reduce your stress or let you know if you should reach out to Student Success.

### Talk to your partner(s)

Whether you are doing pair programming or working alone on projects, you always have an assigned partner, and for solo weeks you'll often have two Learning Partners. Talk honestly with your partner(s) about the stress you are experiencing. Ask them how they are feeling about things. Usually, open communication can eliminate most stress related to collaboration.

### **What if someone reaches out to me about stress?**

If someone reaches out to you about stress, you should always listen to them. It's important to view everyone's experience as valid. It's really important to not tell the person that it's not so bad or that they are overreacting, as that might make them feel even worse. Try to listen and ask if they'd like to receive advice. Discuss different ways that you've dealt with stress that might help this person. Help them identify where to turn to for help.
