# Examine examples of photos with strong and dim lighting

- Choose a room that is well-lit.
- Don't stand in front of open windows (as seen in the first weak example image below). Doing so will make your face appear shadowed.
- Try to face a lamp or light source. The light should be shining in your face. Doing so will brighten your photo and make you much more visible.
- If you're using a lamp as a light source, try choosing one that shines white light, rather than yellow light. White light tends to make photos appear brighter.
- Even if you're not facing a window, try to take your photo during the day, rather than at dusk or night.
- If none of the above is possible, use a photo editing program like Pixlr to adjust the lighting and contrast of your picture. We'll discuss how to do that below.

**Weak example 1:** This photo was taken against a lit window, so the subject's face is shadowed.

**Weak example 2:** This photo is dimly lit, which makes it appear somewhat dark and gray.

**Weak example 3:** The lighting in this photo is far away from the subject, making the photo appear very dark and dim.

# Strong examples

All of the photos above are very brightly lit; the subjects are clearly visible, the surroundings look bright, and there are no discernible shadows on any of their faces.

# How to edit your photo to improve lighting and brightness

If your photo isn't quite as brightly-lit as you would like, you can use photo editing software like Photoshop or Pixlr to improve it. Have a look at [this quick video tutorial walking you through how to edit a photo for brightness using Pixlr](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbhuckPwCT04ctCCB6jam3goe3tvxneW/view?usp=sharing).

As always, editing your photo should be the last resort; your photo will appear much more natural if you have already taken it with good lighting, rather than if you try to manually increase brightness after the fact.
