# Take a professional photo

## Learning objectives

- Show a professional online presence on social media.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this project, you will take the professional photo that you will later be using as your profile picture on professional sites like LinkedIn and GitHub. Be sure to read through the entire article before taking a new photo, to ensure that you know everything you need to do to make it a great photo.

### Why is taking a professional photo important?

The professional photo you use for online profiles will typically be a recruiter's or hiring manager's first impression of you. It's your opportunity to build quick, instinctive rapport with the viewer and to showcase your personality. However, there are a few basic elements that must exist in a professional profile picture, and a few other elements that must be avoided. In this lesson, we'll learn about the elements of a great professional photo so you can either take a new photo or choose which of your current photos to use.

**An important note:** Even if you already know which photo you'd like to use for your professional profiles, you **must** carefully review this lesson. Many students submit photos without reading this curriculum, only to have those photos rejected because of resolution, lighting, professionalism, or another reason. Don't skip over this lesson, or you may have to start all over.

## Make sure your photo bears a resemblance to how you currently look.

Your photo is a hiring manager's first impression of you. If your photo is clean-shaven but you show up to an interview with a full beard, your interviewer may be surprised. Likewise, if you have long, blue hair in your photo but you show up to an interview with a shaven head, the interviewer might wonder if you're even the same person. None of the above will get you rejected, but it can still causing confusion that doesn't need to exist.

If your appearance in your photo is very different from your current appearance, retake the photo. That way, your interviewers won't be surprised when they see you face to face.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you're taking a brand new photo, try not to wear anything that would make you look extremely different than usual (for example, avoid dramatic wigs, unless you normally wear them).
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, make sure that the photo still bears a close resemblance to you. If it doesn't, you will need to either choose a newer photo or retake your photo entirely.

## **The photo should be focused on you, not on your background.**

You are the main subject of a photo, and you want the viewer's eyes to be on you. If anything is happening in the background, you risk distracting the viewer or potentially giving them a negative impression.

You have **three options** when choosing or taking a photo:

- Stand against a mostly blank background. **Make sure that the background is not the same color as your shirt**, and change shirts if necessary. **Preferred.**
- Use a camera that has the ability to **focus on a subject**. This will keep the camera's focus on you, and your background will look blurred. **Preferred.**
- Use a tool like Photoshop or Pixlr to blur the background. **Not preferred.** **This must be done very carefully and with an eye for detail**, and should only be chosen if options 1 and 2 are not currently possible for you**.** We'll give a quick tutorial on how to do this below.

In the link below, we'll examine examples of photos that have strong backgrounds, and some that don't.

**Learn more about the importance of de-highlighting your background:**

[Examine examples of photos with strong and weak backgrounds](examine-examples-of-photos-with-strong-and-weak-backgrounds.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, select a camera that has the ability to focus, **or** pick a location where you'll be able to stand against a neutral backdrop.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, make sure that the photo already contains an out-of-focus or neutral background. If it doesn't, you will either need to manually and carefully blur the background with a tool like Photoshop or Pixlr, **or** you will need to choose a different photo or take a new one.

## **Your outfit and appearance should be professional and tidy.**

Tech tends to be a relatively casual industry, so most software engineers aren't expected to show up to work in suits and ties (especially if working remotely). However, **your professional photo should still look professional and tidy.**

You don't need to wear a three-piece suit (unless you want to). However, there are still some basic standards that your photo outfit and appearance must adhere to.

**Learn more about the importance of a professional appearance in profile photos:**

[Examine examples of photos that display strong and weak professionalism](examine-examples-of-photos-that-display-strong-and-weak-professionalism.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, prepare a work-appropriate outfit and make sure that any hair (including facial hair) is neat and tidy.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, make sure that your outfit and appearance are both professional, and that they avoid the weaknesses of the examples above. If your photo is not professional enough, you will either need to choose a different photo or take a new one.

## **Your photo should be brightly lit, and your face should be clearly visible**

Poorly-lit photos are distracting, unprofessional, and can make it difficult for a viewer to actually see your face. Pay attention to the location of the light, and ensure that your face will be clearly-lit and visible.

In the link below, we'll discuss tips for taking well-lit photos, and review examples of photos with strong and poor lighting.

**Learn more about the importance of lighting in professional photos:**

[Examine examples of photos with strong and dim lighting](examine-examples-of-photos-with-strong-and-dim-lighting.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, select a location that is brightly lit. If necessary, move lamps or open windows to increase the brightness.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, ensure that the photo is well-lit and bright. If your photo is not well-lit enough, you will either need to manually adjust the brightness using a program like Pixlr or Photoshop, or you will need to select another photo or take a new one.

## **Your photo should be taken at a high-resolution, and should be crisp and clear.**

Whether your photo was taken professionally or if you took your photo yourself, you **must make sure that the photograph is high-quality**. Blurry, pixelated, or out-of-focus images can make you seem sloppy or unprofessional.

In the link below, you'll find a few tips to help you take high-quality images, and several examples of high-resolution versus low-resolution images.

**Learn more about the importance of photo quality:**

[Examine examples of high-resolution and low-resolution profile photos](examine-examples-of-high-resolution-and-low-resolution-profile-photos.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, make sure you have access to a camera capable of taking high-quality images. If necessary, find a photo stand you can use to make sure the camera doesn't wobble when taking the picture.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, ensure that the photo is high-quality at 400px by 400px. If it is not, you will either need to select another photo or take a new one.

## **Your photo should seem friendly, and you should be smiling.**

Whether you work remotely or in an office environment, you’ll inevitably be working with human beings, and all human beings want friendly coworkers. Looking too stern or serious in a profile photo might give a viewer the impression that you’re overly stern or serious in real life as well.

You may not find it natural to smile for this picture, especially if you are used to making a more serious face for the camera. However, in most Western cultures, smiling indicates both friendliness and professionalism; a very serious or stoic face can indicate that it might not be enjoyable to work with you. Even a slight smile will help.

Smile; your future coworkers want to know that you’re a kind person just as much as they want to know that you’re a great developer.

**Learn more about the importance of appearing friendly in professional photos:**

[Examine examples of friendly versus unfriendly photos](examine-examples-of-friendly-versus-unfriendly-photos.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, be sure to remember to look at the camera and smile.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, ensure that you are smiling and seem friendly in the photo. If you do not, you will either need to select another photo or take a new one.

## **Your face should be clearly visible, and should be the main focus of the photo.**

As we've mentioned previously, your face is the most important part of your photo. Our eyes are instinctively drawn to faces, and if your face is not clearly visible, you're losing out on an opportunity to build instinctive rapport with a hiring manager or viewer.

**Learn more about the importance of ensuring your face is visible in photos:**

[Examine examples of photos that do and do not display clear facial visibility](examine-examples-of-photos-that-do-and-do-not-display-clear-facial-visibility.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, be sure that the camera will be placed close enough so that your face will take up the majority of the picture.
2. If your'e using a photo that already exists, ensure that your face takes up the majority of the picture. If it does not, you will either need to crop the photo (only if the cropped photo will not be smaller than 400px by 400px), or you will need to select another photo or take a new one.

## **Your photo should be taken at an angle directly opposite your face.**

The angle a photo is taken is an important element of a strong image. Photos taken with the camera angled above or below your face can seem sloppy or unprofessional. When taking a photo, make sure the camera is even with your face and not taken from above or below.

You should also avoid pictures taken in profile (where only one-half of your face is visible, as in the third weak example below). Again, a recruiter should be able to see your whole face.

In the link below, we'll examine photos taken at appropriate vs inappropriate angles.

**Learn more about the importance of appropriate angles in profile photos:**

[Examine examples of photos taken at appropriate versus inappropriate angles](examine-examples-of-photos-taken-at-appropriate-versus-inappropriate-angles.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, be sure that the camera is placed directly opposite your face; you should be able to look straight at the lens, not up at the lens or down at the lens.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, make sure that the photo was taken at an angle directly opposite your face. If it was not, you will need to either select another photo or take a new one.

## **Your photo is natural-looking; if it has been edited, the edits are seamless and unnoticeable.**

We all love fun Instagram filters. However, they have their place, and professional websites like LinkedIn are not that place.

As we've mentioned previously, if you choose to edit your photo (for example, to increase the brightness of the picture or to blur the background), you must do so **with great attention to detail**. The result should be natural-looking. If a random visitor to your LinkedIn profile would be able to immediately tell that your profile photo was edited, the edits are too noticeable.

In the link below, we'll look at a few examples of poorly-edited photos.

And with that, you've successfully reviewed all of the elements of a strong profile photo, and should now be able to both identify strong professional photos and take one yourself.

In our last lesson, we'll give you a few additional examples of photos that meet every requirement: some taken from others on LinkedIn, some taken from your fellow Microverse students.

**Learn more about the importance of selecting well-edited photos:**

[Examine photos that have been poorly-edited](examine-photos-that-have-been-poorly-edited.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you are taking a new photo, ensure that any edits you plan on performing are subtle and unnoticeable. Do not plan on adding visible filters.
2. If you're using a photo that already exists, make sure that the photo has been well-edited and does not contain visible filters. If it has been poorly-edited, you will need to either select another photo or take a new one.

## Review strong examples of great professional photos.

You've learned all about the elements of a great professional photo. In this last lesson, we'll take a look at a few additional examples. Some of these examples come from others on LinkedIn, and some come from your fellow Microverse students. Try to review each photo and identify how it meets each of the requirements of a strong professional photo. Then, when you're done, take your own!
