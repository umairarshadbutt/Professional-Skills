### Estimated time: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to help you build your skills around effective time management by introducing new tools or techniques you can try for yourself.

### Why are techniques for effective time management important?

One of the most valuable skills you can have as an online student—and in the future as a remote worker—is effective time management. The better you manage your time, the easier it is to achieve your goals. Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day, meaning it’s not about how much time you have, but *how well* you can manage it.

Time management techniques are especially important for online students, who are often taking care of family, or juggling other commitments. Without the help of a class to motivate you or having a set time where you need to be in a physical classroom, effective time management is crucial to helping you stay focused.

The learnings from this lesson can also be applied to remote work and your professional life in general.

### Effective time management techniques

Effective time management not only helps with your learning but can also make you more productive at work and in your personal life. If you’re serious about successfully completing your online program, it’s crucial to find a good system to use.
