# Learning independently at Microverse

Microverse has a unique learning methodology where we do not have teacher-led classes. Instead, we try to teach you how to learn and support you while doing so. Software development is an area of work where you will always need to be learning new topics as technologies evolve all the time. By teaching you how to learn, we are setting you up for long-term success.

There are a few skills that are very important to make sure that you become a successful learner.

- You will be **productive** and **efficient** with your time. This means being mindful about the time that you have and not getting lost in rabbit holes (aka the endless stream of information on the internet).
- As a part of successful learning, you will be also **resourceful.** You will know that reaching out for help is a normal part of the learning process.
- You also know who to reach out to or **where** to look to ask for help and unblock yourself.
- You are not afraid to go on google or youtube to find out answers. (but remember the time-boxing tip from earlier!)
