## What is a daily standup?

This lesson will help you become familiar with the value and importance of daily standups at Microverse, which take place at the end of every program day from Monday through Thursday.

### Why are daily standup important?

Daily standups are a common tool in software developer teams and technology companies. They serve a lot of purposes: they help with productivity, bring clarity to your goals, help you communicate with your team, and help you overcome your blockers. We use them internally as a company at Microverse too. We want you to do daily standups every day from Monday to Thursday at Microverse, to help you become more productive hereâ€”and to help you be ready for using them in your software development job after Microverse!

## Exercise

### Instructions

Before you start filling in your first daily standup, there are few key areas you have to think about and critically assess. To do so, remember that your daily standup should serve 2 purposes: 

- help you move forward in the week with your tasks
- update teammates on what you are doing

A daily standup is not just a list of actions. Instead, it's a moment of reflection on how your work is going. Use the following questions as a guide:

1. **What went well today?**

    Did you achieve a goal faster than expected? Great! Write it down. Did you get positive feedback from someone? Go ahead and note it! It's important to keep track of things that go well to celebrate small wins and to give ourselves an overview of what our strengths are so we can do more of that in the future. Celebrating what went well is also known to raise motivation!

2. **What blocked you from achieving your goals?**

    Experiencing blockers or challenges is expected. We cannot expect to operate at 100% productivity and reach all of our goals every week.

    Many different things may keep you from reaching your goal. It's important, to be honest with yourself. Identifying the right issue will help you adjust your goals to improve your performance the following week. Are you not reaching your goals due to productivity issues you can control like lack of motivation or time management? Or are you having difficulties with your partners due to conflict or having different working styles?

    By self-assessing and identifying the blockers, you can actively do something to overcome them, either by reaching out to your standup team, Student Success, or trying out a specific strategy related to your blocker.

3. **What are your three goals for tomorrow?**

    Set three goals using the SMART method. A smart goal should be **specific**, **measurable**, **achievable**, **relevant**, ****and **timely**. ****

    You can refresh your knowledge of SMART goals in the following article:

    - [How do I set great goals?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/how-do-i-set-great-goals.md)
    
4. **What will you do tomorrow to ensure you reach your goals?**

    If something does not work, change it. We often make the mistake of setting the same goals, hoping next week we will finally reach them. But that does not work. Taking the time to reflect on your blockers and turning those into action plans is the way to long-term success. Perhaps you are setting your goals too high or too low? Are you applying the SMART method correctly? Are you diagnosing the right blocker? Do you keep using the same strategy, but it isn't working? What will you change in your behavior that will result in reaching your goals next week? If you aren't sure what to do, it's a great idea to bring it up with your team and get their help thinking what you could change.
