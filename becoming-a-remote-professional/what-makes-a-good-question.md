# What makes a good question?

Good questions respond to the type of information you are seeking, and the time and attention of the person you are asking. There are many different kinds of questions, including:

- Factual or information questions (Where can I find X?)
- Procedural questions (How do I do Y?)
- Questions about feelings or thoughts (What does conflict mean to you?)
- Questions about unknown experiences (What if my first job requires me to move?)

According to author and investor Tim Ferriss, you can get better answers and build more of a rapport with busy professionals you are trying to learn from (e.g. your mentor, your boss, your teacher) if you ask questions that:

- Can be answered quickly
- Include examples
- Aren't something you could answer on Google
- Aren't too broad

In short, good questions are focused and require a bit of thought. But don't let this make you think you should labor over all questions or only ask ones that make you look smart! Ferriss also argues that "dumb" questions are extremely valuable for success. The key is to listen well, overcome your hesitations at looking silly, and ask your questions.
