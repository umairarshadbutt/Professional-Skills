# Weekly retrospectives

## Learning objectives

- Learn to view setbacks and failure positively as opportunities to learn.
- Recognize what a reasonable amount of time is to try solving someone on your own before seeking help.
- Continue expanding toolkit for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome.
- Create a good SMART goal for a weekly goal.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

The goal of this activity is for you to apply goal-setting practices to your weekly retrospective and continue reflecting on how the past week went, as well as think about what needs to be improved and how. 

### Why are weekly retrospectives important?

Weekly retrospectives are a common practice with software developer teams and technology companies. You should use your weekly retrospective as a method to bring clarity to your goals, define what went well, as well as to define which blockers you faced throughout the week. 

### The power of individual retrospectives

Retrospectives can be seen as useful tools for boosting productivity, as they force you to think about what you want to accomplish and map out how you will do it. Ultimately, a weekly retrospective is a great accountability tool, where, at the end of each week, you assess how close you were to complete all the goals you committed to the week prior. At first, it can seem strange or not useful to do that individually, but in fact, research shows that individual retrospectives can be very valuable for improving productivity.

**Guiding questions:**

- How can retrospectives help you improve each week?
- What steps can you take throughout the week to help you do the weekly retrospective at the end of the week?

## Exercise

### Instructions

Earlier in the program, you learned how to create SMART goals and learned how important their role is in helping you form good habits and achieve major personal and program milestones. Those goals will play a major part in your weekly retrospectives. 

Each week we will require you to reflect and critically assess your past progress, achievements, and setbacks. You will also create a personal plan for the following week by defining the most important goals you want to achieve, and formulate them following the SMART goal setting lesson. 

Before you start filling in your weekly retrospective, ask yourself the following questions:

1. **What did I achieve this week?**

    Think about the goals you set for yourself the previous week. How did it go? Did you complete all of them? What was the key action or behavior you displayed that contributed to your success the most? Take a minute to congratulate yourself for those things you excelled at and accomplished.

2. **What were my challenges this week?**

    Think about what was left unfinished or didn't go well for you this week. Did you run into any problems or experience any blockers? What could you have done to avoid or mitigate those issues? Be as honest as possible, since identifying the correct issue will help you avoid these challenges in the following weeks.

3. **What will I commit to doing in the next week?**

    Think about what you want to accomplish in the coming week. Break down your vision into smaller goals and attach a SMART objective to them. Here is a reminder of what makes a goal SMART:

    - It has a **Specific** objective where the outcome is clear and easily understood.
    - You are able to **Measure** your progress against the goal.
    - The goal is realistic and **Achievable**, which helps you complete it.
    - The goal is **Relevant** and reflects where you are in the program and what you are currently working on.
    - The goal is **Timebound** and has a deadline assigned to it.

    Finally, taking into consideration your insights from last week, identify one thing you will do differently in the coming week to work towards your goals.
