# Overcoming procrastination part 2

## Learning objectives

- Understand the reasons for procrastination and how to overcome it and stay productive with SMART goals.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.*

**Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.**

In Part 1 of this exercise, you developed a solid understanding of what procrastination is. Now in Part 2, we will focus on overcoming procrastination by using SMART goals.

### Why is overcoming procrastination with SMART goals important?

Procrastination exists and can be controlled by having deadlines. We sometimes need to set those deadlines for ourselves as we are responsible for our own development. SMART goals help us set deadlines for what we want to achieve, how we want to achieve it, and the time frame in which we want to achieve it.

### Refresher on SMART goals

You previously created your first SMART goal in the exercise "*Goal Setting - Day to Day, Week to Week.*" Here is a quick reminder of what SMART goals are and how you can set them.
