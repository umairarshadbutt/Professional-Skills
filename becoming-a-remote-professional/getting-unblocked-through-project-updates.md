# Getting unblocked through project updates

Project updates can also be used for surfacing blockers. For example:

- You got stuck on a problem and you need help
- You are starting on a part that requires someone else to finish their part.

Everyone gets stuck on a problem or challenge. You shouldn't feel like you need to figure it out yourself. If you get stuck for longer than 30 minutes, then reach out for help! It's an essential part of teamwork to help others get unblocked. You do not need to wait until the project update for help. You can reach out sooner and work on something different while you wait to be unblocked. Then, you can use the project updates to notify your team members that you are still blocked and need help.

While you are stuck, always try to find different things you can work on to avoid wasting time. This is very important in the remote work environment and something your team and your future boss will expect of you. In the remote environment, you will often work with people in different time zones, and answering questions might take longer than in-office work. Therefore being proactive in finding productive things to work on while you wait to get unblocked is important.

**How to ask for help?**

In a remote environment, you should always give as much detailed context as possible when asking for help. For example, sending a Loom video explaining where you are stuck will help others understand what is holding you back. You should shortly summarize your blocker so the whole team can understand where you are stuck and offer more details for the person who will unblock you (no need for the whole team to spend time understanding your blocker).

**Who to ask for help?**

Make agreements with your team on who will help unblock when another team member is stuck. Will it be the first person who sees it? Will you assign a person per day who will help with unblocking? Will you let whoever is most expert in a topic answer? Choose a strategy and assess what is working. Make sure your team's blockers are unsolved and it's not always the same person who is helping others.

**How to problem-solve?**

There are different ways to solve the blocker depending on the type of blocker. Sometimes more questions need to be asked. Sometimes the team member will need to explain where they are stuck using a Loom or in an ad-hoc Zoom call. This will depend on the difficulty of the blocker. Always try to solve it asynchronously first and if the problem is too complex you can jump on a call. For example, if a problem requires more than two Loom videos to answer the question, you should schedule a quick call.
