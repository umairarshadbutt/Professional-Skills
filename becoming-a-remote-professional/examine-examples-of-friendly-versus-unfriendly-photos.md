The first two pictures above are **nearly** perfect; the subjects look professional, the photos are high-quality and brightly-lit, and the background is either neutral or blurred. However, because the subjects look so stern, the viewer's immediate impression might be "I wonder if these people would be just as unfriendly at work."

All of the subjects in the photo above look friendly and warm; the sort of people that a hiring manager would love to hire, and that coworkers would love to work alongside.

A simple smile goes a long way; make sure that your professional photo looks friendly, or you will be asked to submit a different photo.
