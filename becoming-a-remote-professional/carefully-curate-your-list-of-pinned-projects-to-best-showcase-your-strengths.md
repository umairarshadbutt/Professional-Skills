# Carefully curate your list of pinned projects to best showcase your strengths

## **Make sure your projects are actually pinned**

First: make sure that your projects are actually pinned. If you have not pinned projects, GitHub will automatically choose your 6 most popular repositories to showcase on your dashboard. However, your popular repositories are constantly updating, which means you will not have control over which projects a visitor sees.

Make sure that your dashboard says "**Pinned," NOT "Popular repositories."** If your dashboard says "Popular repositories," that means you have not actually pinned any projects, and a project reviewer will automatically reject your project and send it back to you for edits.

## **Choose 6 of your best projects to pin**

The are **two factors to consider** when choosing projects to pin:

1. Showcasing a **range of technologies**
2. Showcasing **your best, most complex projects**

### Showcasing a range of technologies

Good software developers are expected to know several technologies: languages, frameworks, etc. In other words, if you **only pin** Ruby projects to your GitHub dashboard, a recruiter might think that you only know Ruby. That's not good!

Instead, make sure that your six pinned projects feature **at least 3 different technologies**. **A note:** languages, libraries, and frameworks count as different technologies. For example, JavaScript, Ruby, and React would count as 3 different technologies, and Ruby and Ruby on Rails would count as 2 different technologies.

# Showcasing your best, most complex projects

Since your pinned projects are probably the first projects a visitor to your GitHub profile will see, it's important that you pin the **best** projects. That means choose projects that are complex, attractive, and clean.

- **Don't pin website clones** (unless you are a new student and have only created clones so far). Pinning website clones implies that you are brand new to development and have only learned HTML or CSS so far. If you've only created clones so far, you may pin them, but **set a 1-2 month reminder to come back and pin more complex projects later.**
- If you have previous developer experience, **it's okay to pin projects you built previously**! If you previously worked on a cool Python project, feel free to pin it; you don't only have to pin Microverse projects.
- **Only pin open-source projects if you made significant contributions**. Be careful not to mislead people into thinking you're a major contributor to a significant open source project unless you actually are. If you implemented a significant feature (especially if you've gotten multiple separate commits into the project) go ahead and list it. However, if your contribution was relatively minor (e.g. fixing a minor bug in React or adding some documentation), then you shouldn't pin that project.

# **Write a strong project description for all 6 pinned projects**

Strong, informative project descriptions are a great way of not only introducing a hiring manager or recruiter to your projects but also showing your strong written skills. It's therefore very important to ensure that each project description is able to encapsulate a project both concisely and with enough detail to inform.

A strong project description should include:

- A brief description of what the project does
- A list of major technologies used to build it
- 1-3 major features of the project
- Strong grammar, no capitalization or spelling errors

Here's an example of a strong project description:

*"A flashcard app designed to help web developers review data structure concepts. Users can create a profile, save progress, and bookmark difficult cards for later. Built with React."*

Here are four additional examples of great project descriptions written by a Microverse student.

# **Ask your mentors and peers for stars**

The best way to determine the strength of a project is to view the code, but some recruiters or hiring managers do immediately check the star count of a project to form a quick first impression. Your projects will eventually gain stars as more people find them. However, give your projects a head start by starring your friends’ and mentor’s projects and repositories, and then ask them to star yours.

# **If needed, change what languages display on your GitHub projects**

GitHub automatically checks your code in order to identify the most-used language in a project, and then uses that to assign a language tag to the repository. However, sometimes GitHub makes mistakes.

If you need to change the language tag for a project, please [review this tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/59fa5b6712184de09e8a527da02706d3?t=0).
