### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to help you learn how to use Google Calendar to stay organized, efficient and productive. The use of your calendar application to organize your time is known as calendar management, and when it's done well to enhance your productivity, it is regarded as effective.

### Why is effective calendar management important?

Constantly adding meetings and time blocks to your calendar can feel like a waste of time--after all, most of us tend to rely on our own memories. But weâ€™re all humans, and humans forget things sometimes. We miss deadlines, we forget about important tasks, we mix up time zones, and accidentally show up at meetings an hour early (or worse: an hour late).

Managing a Google Calendar can take 10 minutes out of your day, yes--time that you may want to spend coding or relaxing or just grabbing a cup of coffee. It can be boring and repetitive but like many boring, repetitive tasks, it is **absolutely necessary.** Those 10 minutes of organization can be the difference between you missing an interview or not, or between meeting a work deadline and forgetting it. Get in the habit right now of using your Google Calendar, and **continue using it**.

### Effective calendar management practices

**Guiding questions:**

- Do you have a schedule for your working hours and are they represented in your calendar?
