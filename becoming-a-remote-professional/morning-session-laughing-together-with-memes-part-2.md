# Morning session: Laughing together with memes part 2

## Learning objectives

- Appropriately use humor as a tool for bonding with teammates and managing stress.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In today's meme-making exercise you will be learning a bit more about memes, sharing the ones created during the last session, and voting on the best ones. 

### Interesting facts about memes

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

In the last session on memes, we discussed what memes are and shared a brief history of this trend. 

Did you know that...

- "Meme" is derived from the ancient Greek word "mimema", which means "something imitated".
- Almost 60% of all memes created are political in nature.
- Memes are great for branding, as visual content has 40% more chances of being shared on social media platforms than text.
- Video memes exploded in 2005 with the creation of YouTube. Rickrolling—the practice of making [someone click on a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to the music video for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up”—became massively popular.
- Grumpy Cat’s photo was shared so many times online that it went on to receive the “single greatest internet achievement of the year” Webby award in 2013.
- People still argue about the correct way to pronounce meme. Try to pronounce it now in the meeting. Do most of you say "meem", "may may" or "mee mee"? Oxford dictionary says it should be "meem."
- It is impossible to count the number of memes on the internet as there are thousands of new memes made each day.

## Exercise

### Instructions

*Spend the next 20 minutes working on this together as a team.*

1. Today you will be sharing the other memes you created in the last session and will be voting on the best ones per person. You will be encouraged to share your top-voted memes with the rest of the cohort.
2. Share all memes with the group, one person at a time, for example:
    - Team member 1 shares links to all 3 memes they created with the rest of the team. Laugh, discuss and comment.
    - Then, the rest of the team votes for the best meme created by this person.
3. Complete steps 2 until all team members have shared their memes and each person has a winning meme.
4. (Optional) After submitting your exercise, make your fellow students laugh. Share your winning memes with the rest of the cohort, or with the wider school audience in Slack.
