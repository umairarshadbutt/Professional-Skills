# Make final updates to professional photo based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Show a professional online presence on social media.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to either take a new photo or make small edits to your current photo.

## Why is it important to make revisions to your professional photo based on feedback?

If you followed the curriculum, your professional photo should automatically contain all of the necessary elements of a strong profile photo. However, it's difficult to take a perfect photo on the first try, and by listening to constructive critique, you may be better able to identify areas of potential improvement in your photos. Remember: your profile photo might be the first "project" of yours that a recruiter or hiring manager will ever see, so it's important to ensure that your profile photo is as professional as possible. 

If your project reviewer has left you with any feedback, please follow that feedback to either edit your photo or take a new one. A profile photo is your first impression; don't rush it, or you could risk losing out on opportunities that you may have otherwise been a good fit for.

## Project Setup

- Open all written and numerical photo feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- If you need to take a new photo, [review the photo curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/take-a-professional-photo.md) to ensure that your new photo will meet all requirements.
- If you need to make minor edits to your photo, open a photo editor ([like the free Pixlr Editor](https://pixlr.com/e/)) and upload your photo.

## Using project reviewer feedback to finalize your professional photo

As we've mentioned previously, the ability to willingly accept feedback and then use that feedback to improve your projects is a valuable skill. This skill will serve you for the rest of your life, and is a skill that will help set you apart from other job applicants and colleagues. 

Please review the article below once more to ensure that you've memorized our most important tips for using feedback to improve your projects. By now you may have read it a few times, but it's an important list of items to keep in mind before you start editing, and we recommend re-reading it regularly. Once done, you'll be able to use all of the feedback you've received to either take a new professional photo or make some minor edits to your existing photo.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your photo meets every requirement of the photo rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8ee1i_MU9jumfgDbROa4R3kszViDSIZ0NOnOrassPM/edit). If you have followed the curriculum above, it should do so automatically. If you have followed the [photo curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/take-a-professional-photo.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you**. If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- **Remember that this will be your final revision round for your photo until you reach the end of Microverse**. If you rush through the feedback or editing process, any remaining errors or areas of improvement could potentially be left remaining on your professional social media profiles for months, and those errors could mean missing out on job opportunities you might otherwise have been qualified for. The effort you put into taking a stellar professional photo today is an investment; invest that effort wisely.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
