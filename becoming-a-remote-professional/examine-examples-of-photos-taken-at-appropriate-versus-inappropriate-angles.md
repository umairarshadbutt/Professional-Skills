**Weak example 1:** This photo is taken from below so it appears as if the subject is staring down at the viewer.

**Weak example 2:** This photo is taken from below and is angled so that the subject is off-center.

**Weak example 3:** This photo is taken in profile so the viewer can only see half of the subject's face.

# Strong examples

All of the photos above are taken at an angle directly opposite the subject's face; it looks like the person in the photo is looking directly at you, which helps build the rapport we've mentioned previously.
