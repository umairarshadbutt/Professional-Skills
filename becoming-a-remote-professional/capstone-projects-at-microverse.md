### What are capstone projects?

At the end of each module you will do a capstone project at Microverse. Capstone projects are projects that mimic real-world problems that you will solve to measure your mastery of the learning objectives in the given module. They also function as an opportunity for you to see the outcome you've achieved from your learning. Capstones at Microverse are completed individually in some cases, and as part of group projects in others.

### Why did we choose this kind of assessment?

We've modeled capstones to look like the kind of projects you will encounter later in the workplace, and to give you a chance to apply technical and professional skills learned in each module. With the capstone project, you will receive project requirements with specifications, assets, guidelines to follow, and a time estimate for the project to be submitted. Project reviewers will act as your client and will be reviewing your submission and providing feedback to make sure your project matches the requirements.

While you're working on the capstone, you will see that you're well-prepared due to the lessons and projects that you have done leading up to the capstone. If you've done everything along the way, you'll be ready (though having the feeling that you are not ready to start the project or that you don't have enough knowledge is very normal and expected, due to imposter syndrome). Some tasks might require you to research while you're working on the capstone and that's ok! Learning on the job is to be expected for software developers and you should internalize learning as part of any project.

You'll likely feel time pressure in capstones. We enforce deadlines in capstones because while working in a company with a client you will often have tight deadlines. You must learn to prioritize what you will work on in a project given the time limit and to do your best in the time you have.

Once your project achieves mastery, you will be able to move forward to the next module. Not only will you have achieved the technical skills from the module but also soft skills such as project planning, time management, and working under pressure. You can repeat the capstone project if you haven't had a repeat week yet in the given module.

### How can I utilize the capstone projects after the Microverse curriculum?

Capstone projects provide you with great material for your portfolio that you can leverage once you start job searching. When you include capstone projects in your portfolio you give hiring managers an overview of the type of project you know how to build. You'll have similar projects that you need to build during interview processes and later in your software development jobs.
