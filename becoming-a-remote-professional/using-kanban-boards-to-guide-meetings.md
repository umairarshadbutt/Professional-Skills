# Using Kanban boards to guide meetings

Doing a daily standup or project updates using the Kanban board is very similar to doing the daily standup without Kanban boards. You may choose to give updates to your team during meetings using the Kanban board this week. This is optional. It's good practice as you will likely do this later in your software development job. 

When you start the meeting assign a team leader who will facilitate the discussion. This person will assign people to speak, ensure you stay on topic, and finish the meeting on time. This person can choose to share their screen to show the Kanban board while to group discusses what they are working on. Each person takes turns given updates based on their Kanban board. 

On the first day, talk about your priorities for the week based on the Kanban task cards that you have received. Talk briefly about each task or if you have plenty of tasks, define the biggest priorities to discuss. 

For other days, give short updates on the tasks that you have "In Progress" that day. Talk briefly about which cards you completed and how the work went. Also, talk about the cards that you plan to start next and what steps you will take for those. Discuss any blockers for any of the tasks that are either in "This Sprint", "In Progress", or "In Review".

At the end of the update, make sure the next steps are discussed for the blockers of any teammates.
