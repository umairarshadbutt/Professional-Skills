# Examine examples of photos that do and do not display clear facial visibility

Keep these three things in mind when thinking about visibility in photos:

- Make sure that your whole face is clearly visible and centered in the photo.
- Take the photo from the torso up, or the shoulders up. If most of your body is in the photo, your face will be too small to see.
- If necessary, crop your photo to focus on your face. As mentioned previously, this should only be done if the cropped image will be **larger than 400x400 pixels**. If not, you will need to take the photo again.

Below, we'll take a look at a few examples.

**Weak example 1:** This photo is largely professional, but because the photo is taken from a distance, it's hard to see the subject's face.

**Weak example 2:** This photo is almost perfect, but again, because it's nearly a full-body photo, it's difficult to see the subject's face.

**Weak example 3:** Much of the subject's face is off screen, and it's therefore difficult to see him.

# Strong examples

All of the photos above are taken either torso-up or shoulders-up, making the primary focus of the photo the subject's face. This allows a viewer (who could be a hiring manager or recruiter) to clearly see you and form an immediate, instinctual rapport.
