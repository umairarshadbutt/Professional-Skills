# How to run a good standup meeting  
In the standup meeting you will discuss the following questions:

1. What did you accomplish today?
2. What are your goals for tomorrow?
3. What obstacles are standing in your way?

## What to do before the meeting?

Make sure you come to the meeting prepared. Remember, you want to focus on your achievements and blockers, not merely list the tasks you did that day.

## What to do at the start of the meeting?

Choose a meeting leader or use the sorting hat in Slack if you want to assign a leader at random. The leader of the meeting will facilitate the meeting.

- To ask the Sorting Hat, run the /sorting_hat command in your Stand-Up Team Slack channel.

After you've gone through this meeting a few times and you've gotten used to the meeting structure, you can experiment with implementing ice breakers questions at the beginning of your meetings. The purpose of icebreaker questions is to ask questions that allow you to know more about your teammembers. Questions like "What's your favorite type of food?" or "What did you do before Microverse?" Remember, the answers to the ice breaker question should be short so the meeting does not run over time. 

## What to do during the meeting?

During the meeting, each person will give an update to talk about what they achieved that day and communicate any blockers. Other team members listen to the person who is speaking. The purpose of discussing blockers is that team members can be unblocked. 

If you can find quick solutions you can continue discussing during the standup meeting, but if finding a solution takes more than two minutes you must take the conversation offline. If no one knows a solution to the team members' blocker you must agree on how that person will be unblocked after the meeting.

## What to do after the meeting?

Circle back to any blockers that are left unsolved and submit the standup team form from Monday to Thursday (on Fridays you will submit a weekly retrospective instead).
