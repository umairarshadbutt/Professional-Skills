## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce tips to having a professional remote work environment.

### Why is a remote work environment important?

While working from home has its perks, it can be distracting. Errands, chores, family, housemates, TV, social media, and pets can easily shift your attention. Setting up a professional remote work environment can help to eliminate these distractions and improve your chances of landing and succeeding in a remote job.
