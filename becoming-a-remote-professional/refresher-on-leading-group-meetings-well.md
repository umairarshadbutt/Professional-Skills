## Leading group meetings well

This lesson is a refresher on how to lead group meetings well.

### Why is this important?

As we do things repeatedly we sometimes fall into the trap of setting bad habits by accident. To avoid that you should make time to reflect on these habits. This lesson serves the purpose of reflecting to make sure that you are having the right habits to set you up for success while leading standup meetings. 

These habits such as time-keeping, leading discussions, and starting and ending the meeting are very important. They are habits that traditional universities often don't teach and that most junior employees learn while they are on the job. Coming into your job and knowing how to efficiently lead a meeting by sticking to time, being able to have productive discussions that all team members participate in is a great way to impress your future manager.
