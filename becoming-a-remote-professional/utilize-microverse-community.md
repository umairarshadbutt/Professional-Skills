# Utilize Microverse Community

### Getting unstuck when stuck; asking for help.

Asking for help is a **vital** part of successfully learning to become a software developer. It's not only normal and expected to ask questions, but it's necessary. Students often feel like they should know everything on their own, but it's much better to lean on your community to get answers quickly. At Microverse, we prioritize getting your answer fast and efficiently over doing it all on your own. Of course, you should always show that you have tried to find the answer yourself before reaching out to others.

### Microverse Support System

Use your Stand Up team & coding partner as accountability partners. Share your goals, blockers, how you will try to overcome them and when you failed to reach your goal. Sharing them can often lead to gaining more insights from others. You will learn how others deal with similar problems.

Other tips:

- If you get stuck on a problem for longer than 30 minutes- ask for help!
- Schedule 1:1 time with a Code Reviewer or post your question on Discourse when you are stuck on a technical problem
- Reach out to Microverse Staff for help. Especially if you have a collaboration issue if you have problems accessing tools. Reach out to us as soon as possible.
