# Examine photos that have been poorly-edited

We won't take a look at strong examples in this lesson, because the point of good editing is that it should be unnoticeable. However, we will identify a few examples of photos that have been poorly edited.

**Weak example 1:** The background of this photo has been blurred, but the blurring was messily done. The result appears sloppy and is not at all professional enough for sites like LinkedIn or GitHub.

**Weak example 2:** Black and white photos are sometimes acceptable, but this particular photo has been edited to look dim, which makes it difficult to clearly view.

**Weak example 3:** This subject added a starry filter to their face. While filters can be fun to use on personal sites like Instagram, they're not professional enough for sites like LinkedIn or AngelList.

Remember: if you choose to edit your photo, these edits should be as natural and minimal as possible. Project reviewers (and other viewers) shouldn't be able to tell that the photo has been edited; otherwise, you'll be asked to retake your photo.
