# How to report harassment

### What to do if you experience harassment?

If you are being sexually harassed, know that it is not your fault, and we want to do everything we can to help prevent it from happening. If you feel comfortable doing so, we encourage you to tell the person harassing you to stop, either while they're doing it, or after the fact. Try to be clear and specific about the behavior that is making you uncomfortable. 

### How to report it

The reporting process starts withÂ [this form](https://airtable.com/shryKKk4rx7ONEkZo). There, we ask a series of questions to understand the situation better. The form will give you the space to outline what happened and share the frequency and severity of the situation. Through it, you can request to get removed from any current or future collaborative groups with the person who harassed you. You'll also be able to choose whether you want the person to know that you reported it, or to remain anonymous.

You can also choose to fill out the form anonymously. If you do so though, we cannot make changes in your current or future groupings. We fully support your decision and understand if you prefer to stay anonymous. Though, it makes it more straightforward for Microverse to reach out to the person who harassed you if we can give specific examples of what is wrong.

You might feel hesitant to report because you don't want to make a big deal of it or feel like you shouldn't complain. But if you are having any doubts, we always recommend reporting and we will assess the case with you.

### **What happens with the person who harassed you?**

This will depend from situation to situation. At the very least, the person will receive a warning. At three warnings, the student will be expelled. We will have to assess this case-by-case because if the harassment is very severe, we might expel the student after strike one.

We will handle every case with care, respect, and the personalization it deserves.
