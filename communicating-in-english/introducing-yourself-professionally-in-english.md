### Why is introducing yourself professionally important?

Introducing yourself professionally in English is important to help you communicate with confidence to hiring managers and recruiters while you are networking, during your job search, in your interviews, and also when you get a job.

Being able to communicate your skills and achievements clearly to others will increase their attention and make them more inclined to hear what you have to say.

### Preparing a structure to use when introducing yourself professionally

It is important to prepare a structure of words and phrases that you can practice before introducing yourself to someone. This helps you have a constructive flow of thought which in turn, will increase your confidence and help you sound more professional. Below is a structure we propose that you use and practice.
