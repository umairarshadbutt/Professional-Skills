# Structure to use when introducing yourself professionally

- **Say hello and say your name:** This is the first step of any introduction message.
- **State your goal:** This is a good way of letting someone know straight away why you are reaching out to them.
- **Pick skills/achievements from your past experiences:** The skills and achievements you choose to talk about should be related to your goal above so that your introduction flows.
- **Pick skills/achievements from your present experience:** Similarly, the skills and achievements of your present experience should be related to the goal stated above for the same reason.
- **Share excitement and pride about your goal:** This is a great way to show enthusiasm, passion, and drive to your listener or reader.
- **End with a** **question:** When introducing yourself to recruiters or hiring managers, it's always nice to end with a question so that they have a reason to get back to you.
