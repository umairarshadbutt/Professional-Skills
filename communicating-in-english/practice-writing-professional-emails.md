# Practice writing professional emails

## Learning objectives

- Practice writing professional emails and messages in English and use them for networking.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Professional writing skills in technical fields

Knowing how to write clearly at work is more essential than ever. From email to messaging apps, more and more work takes place online in writing. Especially on distributed/remote teams, even project plans and status updates are often recorded in writing on wikis or through collaboration tools.  

### Why is clear, professional writing important for Microverse students?

As a programmer or technical professional, you must be able to both write code **and** communicate clearly with teammates when you have questions or run into problems. Communicating through writing is challenging for everyone, but it can be especially intimidating for students who speak English as a second language (or third or fourth language). Cultural and language differences can also affect **where** key information is presented — at the beginning or end of a message — and **how** key information is presented —  directly or indirectly. Here at Microverse, we believe everyone can learn to write clearly and professionally in English. 

### What are the steps to writing a professional email?

**Guiding questions:**

- How can you learn to communicate better in email?

### Adapting email communication based on the audiences and situations

Communication is a two-way process. It is not just about our ability to say what we want but also for the person we are communicating with to hear and understand what we're saying. We are more likely to listen to others when we feel like they understand us and have tailored their communication to suit our needs. 

Many of us speak differently with our friends than we do with our parents (or grandparents). There can be differences in the words we use, how fast we talk, and even the topics we discuss. When communicating at work, we also need to think about adjusting how we communicate based on where we are, who we are communicating with, and the topic we are discussing. 

### **Guiding questions:**

- How can you sound more polite in email?
- What can you do to make your email more or less formal?

### Practice makes us better

Written communication is complex and multi-faceted. Just as with coding, some of the most important ways you can improve your writing are to review examples of good writing, practice on your own, and get feedback. Opportunities to see examples and practice writing are especially important if English is not your first language or if you live in a place where English is not commonly used for written communication.  

As you progress through Microverse, your job search, and your development career, you’ll probably be sending a lot of follow-up emails to thank people who've met with you during networking events, at interviews, or even just at work. Writing well-written thank-you messages can serve not only to convey gratitude but also to further confirm your reputation as a conscientious and courteous professional.
