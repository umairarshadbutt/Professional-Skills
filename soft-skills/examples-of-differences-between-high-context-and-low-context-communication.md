# Examples of differences between high context and low context communication

Below you will find two different examples of different possible scenarios and the conflict that may result from the difference in communication.

### Example 1:

Juan is from a high-context culture and Ben is from a low-context culture.

Juan is worried about not reaching the deadline for the project. Therefore he approaches his partner about it. He mentions the difficulty of the project and talks about all the parts of the projects that are left to finish. To let Ben know that Juan is worried about missing the deadline, he tells him; it's going to be a lot of work in the next few days. We need to do our best. By saying this, Juan feels like he has made it clear to Ben that he is worried about them reaching the deadline.

Ben who is from a low-context culture listened to what Juan said. He is excited about the week and always loves a challenge. When Juan says they need to work hard, Ben thinks: of course- we always work hard! Ben continues working as he always does. Juan is angry at Ben for not taking his worries into account, but Ben had no idea that Juan was worried.

### How to avoid conflict at Microverse and in the workplace:

In a cross-cultural and remote environment, you should practice low-context communication. This means clearly saying what you want to say. Aim to be direct and as clear as possible. In Juan's case, it would have helped him to say: "I'm worried about reaching the deadline. I would appreciate it if we could find some ways that work for both of us to speed up our work".

### Example 2:

Juan is from a high-context culture and Ben is from a low-context culture.

Juan's babysitter is suddenly sick and he will unexpectedly need to take care of his child today. He tells his partner Ben that the babysitter is sick and that his priorities may lie elsewhere for parts of the day. By saying this, Juan believes that Ben will understand that the child takes priority over the Program and that Juan will be off most of the day.

Ben listened to what Juan said and expects that Juan will only be out for parts of the day. When Juan is unresponsive for more than half of the day, Ben is confused. Why wouldn't Juan tell him that he will be out for the majority of the day?

### How to avoid conflict at Microverse and in the workplace:

In a cross-cultural and remote environment, you must always be direct, clear with as many details as possible. In this case, Juan should have been more specific by saying that he will be out for the majority of the day. It would help the collaboration if Juan told Ben at what times of the day he could check in and give Juan updates on his availability. For example: "I will be out the majority of the day. I will check in with you at noon to give an update on whether I will be able to work in the afternoon as it depends on whether my child can sleep or not."
