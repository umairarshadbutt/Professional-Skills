## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to apply best practices of communication for resolving teamwork challenges.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

**Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.**

In this morning session, you will review best practices in communication and collaboration in teamwork.

### Why is communication and collaboration practice important?

Because whether you are at Microverse, or in your future job, you will have to work in a team with other people. Being able to communicate and collaborate with others is extremely important. It is even more important in remote settings because you are not physically in the same office and this can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and frustration. This is why you need to make sure communication is flowing well between you and the team.
