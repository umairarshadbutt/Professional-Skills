# Morning Session: Feedback refreshers part 2

## Learning objectives

- Learn how to use communication and cross-cultural knowledge as tools when conflicts arise in working relationships.
- Learn the value of active listening as a teamwork and feedback skill.
- Understand that respect is the foundation of strong relationship-building with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.*

In today's Morning Session, we will practice doing a "feedback chain," meaning that we will give and receive feedback from each other.

### Why is giving and receiving feedback  important?

Feedback is everywhere: At Microverse for example, you will give and receive feedback with your coding partners. In your future workplace, you will also give and receive feedback with your manager or team members. Knowing how to give and receive feedback respectfully can really help you in your team relationships. Alternatively, giving or receiving feedback in a non-constructive manner can seriously damage the relationship between you and the other person. This is why it is important to learn to give and receive feedback in a constructive manner so that the exchange is productive and the relationship stays strong.
