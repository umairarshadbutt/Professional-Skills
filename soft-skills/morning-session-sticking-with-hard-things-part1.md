### Why is sticking with hard things important?

> "Nothing worth having comes easy.‚Äù T. Roosevelt

This is a famous quote from Theodore Roosevelt, who was president of the United States from 1901 to 1909. 

It was true 100 years ago and it still is!

Sticking to hard things is important because it means you're into something special, something worth doing. 

Picture yourself as a mountain climber. You are on your way to the top of the mountain where you will admire the most beautiful view. 

At first the journey is easy, you have energy, motivation and the slop is soft. 

But as you reach the top of the mountain, you feel tired and your legs hurt because you've been walking for a long time and the slop is tough. 

Nevertheless, you don't quit, because you know you're almost there and that the view is going to be amazing. You stick to what is hard because you know it will be worth it.‚òÄ üôå

### Feeling stressed and tired is normal

At this stage of the program, you might feel stressed or tired. Know that this is totally normal and that doing hard things is part of the process. 

What matters is that you keep doing your best everyday. 

Keep going, you're doing great.
