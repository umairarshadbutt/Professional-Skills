## Description

In this lesson, you will refresh your understanding of what good teamwork means while working on large group projects.  

### Why is learning about the basics of good teamwork important?

The power of what good teamwork can produce is not hidden to any of us. We have seen it in sports, organizations, project groups, and elsewhere that when teams work cohesively then it produces phenomenal results. 

Very soon you will start working on a large project with a group of 4-5 people. For the project to be successful, it is not enough to produce code. There has to be cohesion amongst team members: 

- Each person needs to know who is doing what;
- Tasks have to be organized and monitored;
- Communication issues have to be dealt with on time, and so on.

Having roles in your team will help prevent and deal with conflicts that can come up, thus ensuring a smooth project advancement and happy team members.

### Get to know each other and set working agreements

Often times when new people come together it does take in a while to get adjusted to each other's working styles. There is no better way to start by getting to know each other. It makes you feel comfortable in each other's presence and sets you up for working together as a team. 

Icebreaker questions can help you get started with knowing each other and breaking the ice.

Once you get to know each other, *setting working agreements with teammates you'll be interacting with every day will help you stay coordinated and work more smoothly together this week*. 

**Remind yourselves what icebreaker questions are, and how to use them in meetings:**

### Assigning group roles

There are several roles that exist when working in a team. These roles will differ as you work at Microverse or in your future job. We have listed below, the main roles you can have in your team once you start your large group work session. Go through each of the roles, read their descriptions, and see which ones correspond most to you. Which of them fit your personality type the most? This could already give you an idea of the type of role you want to play in your upcoming group work. (If you don't remember what your dominant personality type is, the second link below will give you a quick reminder).

**Refresh your memory on the different roles in larger group work and your personality type:**

### Ongoing communication

While working on the team agreements, you would have read about figuring out the communication medium and communicating in difficult scenarios especially conflicts. Conflict and frustration among team members raise a lot of emotion, uncertainty, and fear and this is why most of us try to avoid conflict situations. However, these situations do happen simply because we are human so it is important to practice dealing with conflict situations. Hence it's important to maintain ongoing communication especially more during difficult times.

### Giving and receiving feedback

To best help your group members grow their skills, you should continue to hone your skills at giving feedback to maximize the quality of the feedback you give and to maximize how useful and actionable the feedback is.

In order for us to get better at what we do, we need to receive constructive feedback from those we work with and hone our skills at incorporating that feedback into our work.
