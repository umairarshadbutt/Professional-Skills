# Preparing for your virtual coffee meeting

Do your research and prepare several questions in advance so that you are respectful of their time. You will also exude more confidence and leave a lasting good impression based on your professionalism. 

Avoid asking vague questions such as, "How did you start your career?" Instead, you can ask a more detailed question based on their background such as, "When I reviewed your LinkedIn profile, I noticed that you used to be a teacher. I am also changing careers from teaching to software development. What advice would you give yourself if you had to make the transition from teaching to coding again?

Here are some ideas of questions you can ask based on who you are speaking with:

Developer/Software Engineer

- What is the most exciting or interesting project you have worked on here?

Engineering Manager

- How do you find bugs in your teamâ€™s code?

Recruiter/Human Resources

- How long does the average developer stay with the company?
