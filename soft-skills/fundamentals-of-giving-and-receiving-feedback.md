## How to give positive and constructive feedback

In this activity, we will talk about the importance of giving and receiving feedback. You will get a chance to practice this with your partner, so you're ready to take these new skills into your daily life as a remote professional.

### Why is giving and receiving feedback important?

At Microverse, students work in pairs and teams to learn to code and this brings with it many opportunities to see how each other work up-close. There is great power in learning this way; it’s motivating and gives you access to smart peers every day who are on the same journey you are. However, it can also come with difficulties when you find yourself in disagreement with your partner. Common challenges that come up with Microverse partners—and are similar to the kinds of challenges faced in teamwork at a real job—include:

- One person insisting there’s only one way to learn things or complete projects and not listening to the other’s opinions
- One partner getting too competitive or moving too quickly
- One person consistently not showing up or getting distracted during work time
- One person constantly interrupting and talking over their partner

Learning to work together and move past these kinds of challenges involves learning to communicate about what works and doesn’t work and finding ways to compromise or get help changing the situation when necessary. An important element of this communication is the ability to give and receive positive and constructive feedback.

### What is feedback?

Feedback is information about how another person is doing their work or communicating with others. It is a conversation in response to another’s actions. Feedback can be about praise, but it can also be about learning. Some people think of feedback as a gift, because it is an opportunity to learn about ourselves and get better.

### Learn more about giving good feedback

To learn more about constructive feedback and begin connecting with your own experiences, read the following article, then watch **at least two** of the four videos referenced in the article. If you aren't sure which to choose, watch the first minute or two of each and then choose (or watch all four if you have time!).

**Guiding questions:**

*Keep these in mind while watching the videos.*

- What is good feedback according to the speaker?
- What do you agree with?
- What do you disagree with?
- What else would you like to know?

### Practice giving positive and constructive feedback

Similar to how people practice playing an instrument every day to improve, we know that practicing the skills we are teaching will help you improve as well. In this exercise, you will read about two common scenarios from real Micronauts. Then, you will record a video of yourself delivering the feedback in a constructive way.

### Learn about receiving feedback

Just like it is difficult to give feedback, it can also be difficult to receive it. We generally do not like it when people give us negative feedback, so there are a few steps that you can follow to make sure you learn something from the feedback that is given to you.
