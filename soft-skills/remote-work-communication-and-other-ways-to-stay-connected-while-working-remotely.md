# Remote work communication and other ways to stay connected while working remotely

Remote work communication is the basis of your connection with colleagues in your remote job. Learning how to effectively communicate remotely is crucial to improving your ability to stay connected, and less anxious about isolation. 

There are helpful baselines for remote work communication, and they are as follows: 

- Communicate often.
- Communicate when you have doubts.
- Communicate when you have questions.
- Communicate when you have concerns.
- Communicate when you have feedback.
- Communicate when you have results or successes.
- Communicate your schedule.
- Communicate updates.
- Communicate eloquently.
- Communicate clearly.

Communicating effectively gives the receiver better context of your work-life situation. It also improves productivity and a working relationship between you and your colleagues because it builds trust. 

Connecting with colleagues in a remote setting could also involve keeping in touch and bonding over non-work topics and virtual events. It’s been proven that spending time on non-work activities with coworkers strengthens working relationships. When you’re in the office, you grab lunch with a coworker, dip out to the coffee shop below the office or take your team out for a happy hour. When you’re working from home, how do the social activities and human interactions translate into online methods of communicating? There are fun ways to keep in touch with colleagues while working remotely: 

- Use videos to connect but don't forget to stay professional.
- Attend and look forward to the team meetings, and standups.
- Include some real-time collaboration on projects.
- Schedule small catch-up sessions with colleagues. It would be helpful to use your knowledge of good calendar management practice to check for colleague availability.
- Contribute or comment on jokes in the Slack channel, but remember to keep it work appropriate.
- Celebrate personal milestones like yours or a colleague's birthday, graduation, and so on.
- Join professional developer groups like Slack developer communities and forums.
