# Morning session: Sticking with hard things - part 2

## Learning objectives

- Continue expanding the toolkit for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome.
- Learn to view setbacks and failure positively as opportunities to learn.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

In this morning session, you will continue to improve your ability to recognize and overcome the imposter syndrome. You will also learn how to see setbacks and failures as opportunities to learn.

### Why is sticking with hard things important?

Sticking with hard things is important because this is how you make progress, move forward, and achieve your goals. 

Being consistent, trying your best, and persevering when things get hard is what will set you apart and make you who you want to be. 

> “I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.” - Michael Jordan (Basketball player)

### Choosing your mindset

When things get hard or don't go as planned, it's easy to fall into a negative mindset. 

A negative mindset might take the form of a little voice in your head saying things like "you can't do this, you're not good at that, you should quit, you'll never succeed." etc. 

However you can also CHOOSE to see things from a different perspective and activate your positive mindset. 

Your positive mindset voice would say things like, "*yes this is not easy or you made a mistake here BUT look at all the other things you've achieved in the last few months! You've done great.*" 

Or, "by making this mistake, you're actually learning a lot!" 

Note that choosing how you want to react to a bump in the road will make all the difference on your motivation and mood. 

### Group discussion

**Spend 15 minutes working on the group discussion**

As a group come together and talk about what you learned from talking to people about their lives. Choose one person to focus on, in between the two persons you interviewed. 

One by one : 

1. Share basic information about the one person you want to talk about: 
    - What is the first name of this person?
    - How are you related? Is is a parent, a sibling, a neighbor?
2. Share the answers to the questions you asked:
    - What's the hardest thing they've ever done in their life?
    - Did they ever feel like giving up?
    - What helped them push through?
    - What is one piece of advice they have for someone going through hard times?
