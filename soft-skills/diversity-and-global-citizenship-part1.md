## Diverse communication

Last week we talked about two different frameworks to talk about differences between cultures. Of course, there are many different kinds of differences between individuals across the globe. This lesson will discuss how to communicate about differences.

### Why is communication about diversity important?

Learning to communicate about differences in a respectful way is important for multiple reasons. Firstly, you will only learn about others through curiosity. By asking the right question and getting to know others you will be able to understand the differences and learn about these differences. This improves your cultural awareness and your ability to collaborate with different teams across the globe.

Secondly, it requires some thought to ask questions and communicate about individual differences in a way that you do it with respect and without offending the other person.

### Communicating about diversity
