Time management skills and best practices include various skills and tips that will help you manage your time well. Some of the most important time management skills and best practices include: 

- **Planning**: A fundamental time management skill is planning. Planning means broadly looking at the workload you have to get through and effectively laying it out in smaller parts.
- **SMART goal-setting**: A great way to manage your time effectively is to set SMART(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Result-focused, Timely) goals. Setting SMART goals allows you to determine what tasks need to be prioritized and makes sure your tasks are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This process increases your chances for success in a project.
