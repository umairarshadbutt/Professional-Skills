# 10 best practices for good team communication and collaboration

1. **Communicate early and often about issues**: Don't wait till days have gone by to tell your team issues you are struggling with. Try to do this in every standup. Reach out to others in a team when you need help.

2. **Give regular constructive feedback to your teammates:** What is something they can improve upon? And how can they improve upon it? Make sure to give constructive feedback. Remember the rule for constructive feedback: "***Always give feedback with respectful consideration to the confidence of your peers***". Propose constructive solutions or ideas to your teammates.

3. **Treat each other as whole people:** Remember that you are more than just developers. You are human beings with feelings, emotions, and struggles. Treat each other with kindness and respect.

4. **Plan and assign tasks**: It is important to break down a project into smaller tasks for each member of the team to do. Planning and assigning tasks helps us know who is working on what and creates more clarity.

5. **Give regular daily updates on your work:** Remember that others cannot see you in a remote setting so they don't know what you are doing until you tell them. Make a habit of having daily regular checking with the team where you share your updates, struggles, and future goals.

6. **Overcommunicate:** Make use of the various communication channels: emails, videos, phone calls, Slack, etc. to make sure you are communicating regularly with your team. This is extremely important in remote settings as it creates more visibility amongst team members and will help create a strong team bond.

7. **Celebrate any group wins:** Did someone solve a bug? Did someone create a new feature? Celebrate these little wins as a group. This will help strengthen team bonding and collaboration.

8. **Share fun things with each other apart from work:** Coding can be stressful so learning about each other beyond work can create a fun atmosphere to work in. Create sessions where you can talk about fun things together. This will help create a strong team bond.

9. **Recognize each other for something positive:** Give a shoutout to a member of your team when they have done something positive, no matter how big or small.

10. **Reflect on your teamwork as a group:** What have you learned about teamwork by doing this project together? What can you improve for your next team project? What will you take into your future workplace? Reflection is extremely important to help you grow your teamwork and collaboration skills.
