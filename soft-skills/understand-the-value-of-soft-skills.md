## Learning objectives

- Articulate the value of soft skills for success on teams.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this activity, you will learn what soft skills are and why they are important to have. You will also learn to identify and develop your soft skills.

### Why are soft skills important?

As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.

Recruiters look for these skills when they are hiring to see whether the candidate will be a good cultural fit for the company on top of having the technical skills. Thus, it is very important to  develop your soft skills.

### What are soft skills?

Soft skills are the more transferable skills of a candidate, such as communication, decision-making, collaboration, teamwork, time management, creativity, etc. They are all very necessary for a good cultural fit and can be very good predictors of future job performance.

### Identifying and building my soft skills - the TESTCOLOR personality test

In the exercise below, you will be doing a personality test with colors. This test was developed by Thierry Leroy, a clinical psychologist using the idea that classic personality tests based on a series of questions suffer from the social desirability bias and that the person answering the questions will often try to answer in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others or by themselves unconsciously. The TESTCOLOR test uses emotion as a base indicator rather than logic which reduces the feeling of giving a right or wrong answer and thus increases accuracy.
