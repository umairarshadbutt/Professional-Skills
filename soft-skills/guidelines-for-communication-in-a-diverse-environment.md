# Guidelines for communication in a diverse environment

### 1) Treat everyone with respect

Treat every Microverse community member and Microverse staff member as a valuable Micronaut.

### 2) Communicate clearly

Always be as explicit as you can about what you are trying to communicate. Working across cultures can result in a lot of misunderstandings and conflict. Avoid this by communicating clearly and not assuming the other person has understood what you said.

**Example 1:**

- Sometimes the things you say make me feel uncomfortable. Could you pay attention to that?

Instead use:

- Sometimes the things you say make me feel uncomfortable. Specifically when you say things like "*Insert what person said*". It made me feel "*insert your feeling*" because "*insert explanation why it made you feel that way*". Could you pay attention to that?

**Example 2:**

- Let's review the difficult materials of today and discuss questions about the materials in our next collaboration call.

Instead use:

- Let's review todays material starting at "*insert the specific part of the curriculum where you will start*" until "*insert the specific part of the curriculum where you will finish*" and discuss questions about the materials in our next collaboration call.

**Example 3:**

- I am experiencing internet problems today, but this will be solved later today.

Instead use:

- I am experiencing internet problems today. I expect it to be solved by 1 pm today. I will reach out to you with update at that time incase it is not yet solved.

### 3) Listen with empathy

Always assume positive intent in the other person. Always try to understand the situation from their point of view. Ask questions to understand their situation.

### 4) Learn about differences

Everyone is different. People might have different ways of communicating, learning, and approaching problems. You can learn a lot by asking people.

- You can always ask others as long as it comes from a point of curiosity.
- Ask questions with an open tone to learn and better understand.
- Do not have a judgmental tone.

### 5) Come from a place of openness and curiosity

Ask questions so you can learn about different people and their cultures. Most people love talking about their own culture, but they won't always think to share until you ask. Some people say culture for people is like water to a fish. The fish doesn't know any different than water, so can't imagine the world beyond. Ask questions to learn more, and share when others ask you.
