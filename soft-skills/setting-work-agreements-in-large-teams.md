# Setting work agreements in large teams

Collaboration can be hard at times. Teams don't always get along, and people want to do things differently. Misunderstandings can happen. Working agreements help set you up for success with each team member you have so you can work together and resolve any issues that arise. 

Read through the following areas of common working agreements:

- **What time you will meet each day**
- **How you will work together**
    - How are we going to make decisions when we disagree on how to proceed? (e.g. take turns deciding who will make the decision; talk about it and come to agreement)
    - How do you feel about people making changes to your work when you are not available?
    - What will you do when you donâ€™t agree with the work someone delivered?
    - What will you do when someone is late with their part of the work?
    - What will you do if someone is not putting in the work?
- **How you will communicate**
    - If one of you will be late, how will you tell each other? (Slack? WhatsApp? Other?)
    - If one of you will be absent, how will we let each other know?
    - If one of you gets frustrated by something, how will you talk about it?
    - If one of you can't understand the other's English or need them to slow down, how do you tell them?
- **Study agreements**
    - How you will study? (alone or in group)
- **Workspace and equipment**
    - What you will do in case the workspace is causing problems with productivity?
