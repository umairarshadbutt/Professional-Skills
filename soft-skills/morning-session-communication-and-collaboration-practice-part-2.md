# Morning Session: Communication and collaboration practice part 2

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to apply best practices of communication for resolving teamwork challenges.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

**Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.**

In this morning session, you will review and practice techniques for dealing with conflict and frustration in teamwork settings.

### Why is communication and collaboration practice important?

Throughout your career as a developer, you will have to work on team projects with other people. Poor collaboration (or no collaboration) threatens your project's success. Being able to communicate and collaborate with others is important especially in remote settings since the virtual distance can increase misunderstandings, conflict, and frustration. This is why you need to make sure communication is flowing well between you and the team. 

### Recognizing conflict and frustration in teamwork

Conflicts and frustrations can happen for different reasons in a team. These frustrations can quickly escalate causing tension, demotivation, and slower productivity in the team. This is why it is important to recognize conflict situations as soon as possible and deal with them.

In this exercise, we will outline the most common issues that cause conflict and frustration in a team and affect the development of your team project.
