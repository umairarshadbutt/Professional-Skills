# Using a growth mindset to overcome challenges

## Learning objectives

- Learn to view setbacks and failure positively as opportunities to learn.
- Recognize unhealthy competition and comparisons with others and use a growth mindset to maintain a positive focus.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, we will practice developing a growth mindset to overcome challenges.

**Plan to spend about 20 minutes doing the reading part of this exercise, to allow sufficient time for the exercise.**

### Why is using a growth mindset to overcome challenges important?

Because as a famous person once said: *"Life will throw challenges at you, there is no such thing as a problem-free life so no matter your background, situation, education or whatever, you have to already decide, right now, in your mind, that you are going to win!".*

What they are describing is the growth mindset: a mindset that you can start developing now which will help you get through any challenges—whether they are at Microverse, in your future developer job, or even in your personal life.

### A reminder of the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset

**Guiding questions:**

- Can I actually change my mindset? Or is it fixed and out of my control?

Think back to your first week at Microverse. It may have seemed like a hugely complicated set of new tools or a new way of working online with people that you didn't even know or even the process of completing daily forms which you had never done before.

You could have said, *“I just don’t have it in me, this isn’t my thing!.”* This would be a fixed mindset way of thinking. But instead, you took the growth mindset approach: you practiced, you went through each week, you learned to use the new tools a bit more, you started learning to work remotely with others in a team, you did your standups and retros. You practiced more and more with each coming week. Now, you are doing these things with more confidence than when you were in your first week at Microverse.

Mindset is the way our brain perceives ourselves and the world. A growth mindset is believing in the power of yourself and your brain and its ability to develop when we try difficult things, use the right strategies, and don’t give up. A growth mindset is knowing that with practice we will get better at something.

A fixed mindset means you think you can’t get better at things, even if you practice. Having a fixed mindset means believing you were born one way and cannot change. A fixed mindset makes you want to quit or give up at the first failure because you decide you are just not good at it.

### What exactly is a challenge or a failure?

Failure tends to have a negative perception, whether at work, with family, or elsewhere, but there is also another side to failure that we rarely speak of. Failure is actually the foundation of all learning. Failure is a gate by which we must all pass, once or several times, in order to access the tower of knowledge and skill. Without failure, it is impossible to know anything or learn anything new. This is especially true in the world of tech where coding failures are bound to happen. Every good developer will have their fair share of battle scars and stories of bugs they struggled for hours to fix, and finally fixed in some way or the other. Failure is a necessary part of learning, especially in coding.

### Why does failure look and feel bad?

Traditionally in our societies, people are punished for "failing" and praised for "succeeding" and people's views of us can affect us and make us feel bad. Also, experiencing a failure does not feel good because it usually comes with feelings of humiliation, shame, fear, or anxiety, all of which make us feel unhappy. It is thus very important to learn how to bounce back from a failure and one way to do this is by developing a growth mindset.

Learning to bounce back from failure involves learning techniques to train your mind to think differently.

## Exercise

**Plan to spend about 40 minutes doing this exercise.** You'll notice it's longer than some others in the curriculum, but we think you'll find it extremely helpful for learning to reframe failure with a growth mindset.
