# Examples of conversation starters to use when practicing best communication in a team

1. **Best practice 1:** **Communicate early and often about issues.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi team, I'm having an issue with developing X and would like some help.
    - Hi team, can anyone help me a bit with this feature I'm developing? I know we are all busy at the moment so whenever someone can, I would appreciate it. Thank you!

2. **Best practice 2: Give regular constructive feedback to your teammates.** 

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi Mary, thanks so much for the feature you developed yesterday! Your work is brilliant!
    - Hi Peter, thanks for showing up on time for the project meeting. Really appreciate it.
    - Hi Xavier, I just wanted to raise a topic with you privately. I noticed you didn't attend last week's team meeting and as you know, this is when we discuss project updates and next steps. This affects the team when this happens...Did anything block you from attending? Is there any way we can help you attend future meetings?

3. **Best practice 3: Treat each other as whole people.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi Xavier, I just wanted to raise a topic with you privately. I noticed you didn't attend the last two team meetings we had. Is everything okay? You might have a lot going on in your personal life or just in general. Would you like to talk about it? Or just chat? Please let me know if there's any way the team can help.
    - Hi team, how is everyone doing today? Let's check in with each other before we start talking about work.

4. **Best practice 4: Plan and assign tasks.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi team, before we start the project, let's assign tasks so we know who is doing what. So share your opinion: who would like to do X task? Who would like to do Y task? Who would like to work as a pair on task Z?
    - Hi team, do you think we should assign roles in our project team? Should we have a leader and should this role rotate from one team member to another each day?

5. **Best practice 5: Give regular daily updates on your work.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi team, here's my update on what I have done today and what I am planning on working on tomorrow.
    - Hi team, so today I have done X and Y. I am stuck on Z, but I hope to complete it soon.
    - Hi team, so today I did X and Y but I can't find out how to do Z and it's so frustrating. Would anyone have a bit of time to take a look with me?

6. **Best practice 6: Overcommunicate.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Hi team, let's create a slack DM just for our group and share any updates or info we have there.
    - Hi team, I'm about to commit this code to GitHub in 1 hour. Let me know if you don't agree!
    - Hi team, since some of us work in different time zones, can we send a written check-up when we finish work every day so they know the status of the project when they wake up?

7. **Best practice 7: Celebrate any group wins.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Kudos to Eric for solving the bug on the google API data fetch! Thank you, Eric!
    - Team, we just reached our MVP goal! Super work everyone! Let's celebrate!

8. **Best practice 8: Share fun things with each other apart from work.**

    **Conversation starter examples:** 

    - Hi team, let's take 5 minutes before the meeting to share something fun we love to do in our spare time.
    - Shall we do a Friday after-work zoom call where we have a fun chat, play games, or do other cool stuff together?

9. **Best practice 9: Recognize each other for something positive.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - I just want to say a big thank you to Mary for stepping in and helping us solve the bug we had yesterday on the contact form implementation. Thank you!
    - Thanks so much Peter for making sure everyone in the group feels good. Your careful attention did not go unnoticed and it is sincerely appreciated.

10. **Best practice 10: Reflect on your teamwork as a group.**

    **Conversation starter examples:**

    - Okay so now that we are halfway through the project, should we take 30-minutes to reflect on what we did well, what we aren't doing so well, and how we can improve?
    - Huge congratulations to us all for the work we have done on the project! Now that we have it, how does everyone feel? Do you feel like we worked well together? Did we practice our project-management skills? Our teamwork and collaboration skills? Our ability to communicate through conflict?
