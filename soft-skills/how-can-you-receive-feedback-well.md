# How can you receive feedback well?

Being on the receiving end of constructive feedback can sometimes feel like an attack or an insult, even when it is not meant that way. This is a natural reaction, but one we have to learn how to control and put into the right perspective. If the feedback you are receiving is open, respectful, fact-based, kind, and direct, then you should think of it as a gift; as something of great value, because it something you can use to improve your skills as a professional.

When receiving constructive feedback, you should:

- **Be humble and empathetic**: Recognize that it can be just as difficult for your teammate to offer you feedback as it is for you to hear it. Nobody really likes to hear any form of, *"You could've done a better job on that."* Your teammate knows how hard to hear feedback can be at times and will often bristle at having to give it. You can help reduce tension by letting your guard down and letting your teammate know that you value their perspective and want to understand how they feel.
- **Expect to be surprised**: Feedback will often surprise you. This makes sense because if it were not surprising, you probably would have already incorporated that feedback into your workflow and made those improvements already. If you go into the feedback expecting to be surprised, you will be less likely to have a negative emotional reaction to what you're hearing or snap at your teammate. Your goal should be to receive the feedback in a way that is reflective and thoughtful, and to fully process what you're hearing before responding.
- **Discuss how to incorporate the feedback constructively**: How can you address the main point of this feedback in a specific, actionable way? Can you change one of your work habits to improve your approach? Can you adopt a new tool that will improve your efficiency? Is there some supplemental reading you can do to expand your knowledge? The steps to take will depend on the feedback you are receiving. Often the person offering you the feedback will have ideas on what you could try, or at least will be willing to brainstorm ideas with you. Take advantage of that. Having specific steps you can take to move forward will make both of you feel that it was a productive and useful conversation.
