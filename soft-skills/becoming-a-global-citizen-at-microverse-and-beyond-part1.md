## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ongoing knowledge of the Code of Conduct and how to seek help if you see breaches in it.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Understanding the Code of Conduct

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 10 minutes on this section.*

A Code of Conduct is a reference to help everyone in a group or organization understand how they are expected to treat each other. While most of the code will speak about actions that are encouraged, it may also address certain behaviors that should be avoided.

### Why is a Code of Conduct important?

Individuals and different groups have their own expectations about what is considered *acceptable behavior*. When working in companies with people of different ages, genders, religions. and backgrounds, it is important to have explicit guidelines about what *acceptable behavior* would be within that setting. This is even more important when working in a multi-national company with employees in different countries.

They describe what a code of conduct is, how it can clarify a company's values, and how it can be used to support diversity and inclusion.
