# Get to know your team and set working agreements

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the value of making equal contributions to group projects to produce the best outcome.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will divide the roles again for your capstone project and set work agreements. 

### Why is getting to know your team and setting working agreements important?

No matter how much experience you have working in groups, defining roles and agreements is always important. Even more so in international and remote teams as the chance for miscommunication is higher and getting feedback on something can be slower. Each project should start with defining roles and work agreements and you will continue to do so later in the workplace.
