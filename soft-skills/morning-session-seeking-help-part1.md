# Morning Session: Seeking help Part 1

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to ask for help in an appropriate period of time when stuck on something.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

In this lesson, you will practice seeking help when stuck on something.

### Why is seeking help important?

Asking for help is a **vital** part of successfully learning to become a software developer. It's not only normal and expected to ask questions, but it's necessary. Students often feel like they should know everything on their own, but it's much better to lean on your community to get answers quickly. At Microverse, we prioritize getting your answer fast and efficiently over doing it all on your own. Of course, you should always show that you have tried to find the answer yourself before reaching out to others.

### Group discussion

**For the next 15 min, as a group share your responses for these questions:** 

- What did you do over the break (coding and non-coding)?
- What was the best part about the break?
