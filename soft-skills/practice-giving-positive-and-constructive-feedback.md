# Practice giving positive and constructive feedback

Read the following scenarios, which come from real Micronauts.

- **Scenario 1:** **Partner Misses Meetings without Communicating.** Sergio is your coding partner. He has missed multiple meetings without any communication beforehand. The reasons are always good reasons for missing, and you understand once he explains, but you are starting to feel like you can't rely on him to show up. You are thinking of letting Student Success know, but first want to give him some feedback to see if he changes his actions.
- **Scenario 2: Partner Rushes and is Overconfident.** Lindon had some experience with coding before Microverse and is very confident in his abilities. At first, you learn a lot from him, but with time find that he rushes through the curriculum too quickly. Lately, you notice this is affecting both of your learning because he doesn't dedicate the time needed to learn new things but then thinks he knows more than you because he started out ahead. Give Lindon some feedback about his learning style and how it's impacting your work together.

Now think about how to give Sergio and Lindon positive and constructive feedback. What should they do differently? How can you tell them so, following the best practices for giving constructive feedback? Gather your ideas using the best practices for providing feedback described in the article and videos in this lesson. Also, be sure to:

- Think about how to be honest, kind, direct, and respectful
- Describe how the behavior is impacting you/your work
- Suggest changes or steps needed
- Invite follow-up or continued conversation

Once you have prepared your feedback, record a video of yourself delivering the feedback to **Sergio and** **Lindon** in a constructive way. Spend about 1-2 minutes giving feedback to each person. Please record your feedback using Loom and offer feedback to both people in one video.

Share your video with your coding partner and ask them to watch the video. Ask them to share their video as well. Then, give each other suggestions for improvement and talk about your preferences for giving and receiving feedback.
