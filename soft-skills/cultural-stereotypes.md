# Cultural Stereotypes

### Where do cultural stereotypes come from?

As our brains process a lot of information all at once, it tries to be efficient when making decisions, so instead of analyzing every small piece of information that comes in, it jumps to conclusions quickly. These conclusions are often wrong, and this causes cultural stereotypes. Cultural stereotypes are mental pictures that we have about people based on their cultural background.

### Why are cultural stereotypes bad?

Cultural stereotypes may lead to tolerating racism, sexism, agist, inappropriate comments, jokes, or images about a person. These can be harmful to the person who is the subject of these cultural stereotypes. In the workplace, this may lead to low productivity, low morale, and employees leaving their jobs. Likewise, at Microverse, comments like these may lead to someone feel uncomfortable, bullied, and hindered in their education. Cultural stereotypes are not tolerated at Microverse and may result in expulsion.

North Americans are wealthy, Europeans don't work hard, South Americans are extroverted, and Africans are great at sports. Do these sound familiar? These are examples of stereotypes about cultures that are often not true about individuals. We all have stereotypes about different cultures, countries, or continents. Sometimes these are positive, but more often these are negative. Stereotypes are part of being human, and often we learn them from our parents, our education, or the media.

### Working against the stereotypes.

We need to recognize that we have explicit or inexplicit stereotypes about certain cultural backgrounds and actively learn to see the person before their culture and to question the stereotypes and beliefs that we have. While you work with people from different cultures at Microverse, take an active learning approach to work against the stereotypes and learn about the person you are working with. Understand that stereotypes do not define a person. Instead of focusing on the stereotypes, focus on the person's capabilities, actions and words.
