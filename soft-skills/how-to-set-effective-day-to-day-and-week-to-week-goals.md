# How to set effective day-to-day and week-to-week goals

The easiest way to reach your big goals is to break them down into smaller chunks. Not only does this turn massive, scary, overachieving goals into manageable and exciting tasks, but it allows you to see progress, build your momentum, and fight procrastination. In sum, setting daily and weekly goals is important because: 

- They show your progress (even when you don’t think you’ve made any).
- They bring a level of control and prioritization to your day.
- They give concrete steps for what needs to be done.

A helpful way to start setting daily and weekly SMART goals are to identify your monthly goals and then work backwards by breaking them into weekly and daily goals. 

**Setting monthly goals**

To set your monthly goal, you'd need to find out what is expected of you to accomplish in the Microverse program for the month. You may also want to think about your other goals, like networking goals. Give yourself a realistic overview of the monthly goals using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Result-focused, Timely) framework. 

**Setting weekly goals**

You can break down a monthly goal into four parts (reflecting the four working weeks in a month). To help achieve this, think about what weekly activities and study progress are required to complete a monthly goal. 

**Setting daily goals**

You can set your daily goals by first mapping out a list of tasks to be completed to help you achieve your weekly goals, then deciding what day of the week you would like to accomplish each task or set of tasks. This is an effective way to avoid procrastination. When other unplanned tasks come up in competing priority with already-set daily goals, you would find it helpful to use the 4-Quadrant prioritization model. Employing time management techniques are a great way to ensure focus and success in accomplishing your daily goals. 

## Tips to bear in mind when setting day-to-day and week-to-week goals

- Ensure your monthly goal follows the SMART goal-setting framework. This gives you time to introspect on your goal's specificity and relevance while making sure it aligns with your current Microverse program expectations.
- Use the time management techniques to improve your productivity and execution of your daily goals.

## Using the weekly and daily goal-setting framework to complete your weekly retrospectives and daily standups

The aim of the daily standup and weekly retrospective forms is and has always been to help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and whether you are hitting the goals, you set yourself on a daily or weekly basis. 

Both the daily standup and weekly retrospective forms are now more orientated to setting goals. In the weekly retrospective, you will set three goals for the week ahead. The following week you will let us know if you met these three goals and identify the reasons why you either did or didn't meet your goals. If you were blocked by anything, you'd be able to let us know, but we have also provided a space for you to think about what actions you can take to make sure you are not blocked by the same blocker next week. For example, if you didn't meet your goals because hardware issues blocked you, you should use the form to think about what you can do to solve these issues before next week.

The daily standup form also follows the same routine, but you'll be thinking about your daily goals this time. Let's say you set a weekly goal on Friday to complete the HTML Bootstrap project each day. We can break this big goal into smaller goals, such as completing the required readings or committing more code to your project. You will then ask yourself each day if you met your goals from yesterday and why. Maybe you didn't complete the readings because you worked on a side project, or maybe you had a computer issue that stopped you from committing any code. You can then think about what you'll do tomorrow to make sure these blockers get demolished!
