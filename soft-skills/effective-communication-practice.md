# Effective communication practice

Communication is the key to maintaining positive relationships at work. You can improve communication in your relationships with coworkers, family and friends by practising these skills daily. In this article, we will discuss how to communicate effectively in a working relationship. 

**Listen actively**

Listening actively shows that you’re interested in what your colleague has to say and that you respect them. Listen to them closely, and look at them directly as they speak. While they’re talking, don’t interrupt them. You’ll only be able to understand what they’re trying to say if you listen to them closely and wait for them to finish speaking before you reply. Then ask questions to clarify any issues you may have. Most importantly, don’t email or text while someone’s talking to you.

**Speak with discretion and use video calls or recordings often (or face-to-face if possible)**

Speaking with discretion is the ability to know when to speak and when not to speak. It prevents any misunderstandings with your colleagues because you can understand when to listen and when to respond or engage. Face-to-face or video communication helps build trust and openness, enabling you to sense and understand someone’s viewpoint and feelings. Also, talk face-to-face or use video calls to resolve disagreements, fix complex problems, and use clear, friendly, and polite language.

**Build and earn trust, and communicate project delays effectively**

For effective communication to occur, everyone must trust and respect each other. To build trust with your colleagues, you must act consistently and with integrity. To earn their trust, communicate clearly, collaboratively and confidentially with them while showing them respect. Clear and concise communication will allow your colleagues to understand and then trust you. As a result, there will be more cooperation and less conflict in the workplace. Your main objective for communicating with colleagues is to lay the foundations for trust. 

Another great way trust is built by being transparent on project status and communicating delays effectively. Do this by offering status updates on tasks and projects and also letting your colleagues know in writing and professionally of any challenges causing project delays. 

**Offer constructive criticism**

When giving feedback, leave your personal feelings out of it and make sure your colleague fully understands what you’re telling them. If someone did a great job, offer positive reinforcement and also give them improvement tips without being mean or bossy. 

**Include how what you’re communicating is relevant to the receiver** 

Your communication is only relevant if related to what the other person wants, expects, needs, fears or desires. Figure out how what you’ll say or write is relevant to your colleague, then tell them about it. If what you’re communicating is indeed relevant to them, then it will keep them listening to or reading what you’re trying to say.

Overall, when communicating with your colleagues, you should maintain confidentiality and treat them as you’d like to be treated. It’s also important to have open lines of communication between colleagues and team members to serve each other better.
