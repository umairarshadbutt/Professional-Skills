# Build better working relationships

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate knowledge of how to use different "icebreaker" questions for building relationships with teammates.
- Understand that respect is the foundation of strong relationship-building with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 1hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own for 3 minutes while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

This lesson digs deeper into why relationship building is important and how it can help you in group work.

### Why is building working relationships important?

As you work on projects together you spend a lot of time together. Having good relationships with your peers can make the work more enjoyable. You don't have to be best friends or get along on a personal level, but it helps to know more personal things about each other and more importantly to have strong working agreements that you can fall back on when things don't go as well as planned. 

### Group discussion

- Spend 10 minutes talking about relationships at Microverse for you so far:
    - What's hard about collaborating with other Micronauts?
    - How have you seen it helps to know your teammates personally?
    - Does remembering to do personal relationship-building feel easy or hard to you?

### How relationship building can support you in the workplace

*Spend the next 5 minutes reading through this part individually.*

Now, you'll be learning more about relationship building. 

Guiding questions:

- Why should you invest in relationship building with colleagues?
- What's the benefit of taking the time to talk about non-work-related topics?
- How does talking with your teammates help you divide work and be more productive?

*Now that you have learned individually, spend the next 10 minutes watching the following videos together and commenting on what you learn about team building from Micronaut alums. Remember the guiding questions above.*

### Getting to know each other as a group

We often talk at Microverse about the importance of relationship-building with teammates. In a remote environment, relationship-building has to be more intentional, since you don't "run into" teammates in the break room or in the library on campus as you might in a physical office or school. Icebreaker questions help a lot with relationship-building.

**Remind yourselves what icebreaker questions are, and how to use them in meetings:**
