# **How to learn from the feedback you receive**

Just like it is difficult to give feedback, it can also be difficult to receive it. We generally do not like it when people give us feedback so there are a few steps that you can follow to make sure you learn something from the feedback that is given to you.

**Step 1: Listen. Don’t reply automatically or justify yourself.**

Our first reaction with criticism or feedback is often to disapprove or defend ourselves. No matter how many times we get feedback: it will always hurt at first. Take at least one second before responding and remind yourself to be calm.

**Step 2: Be open. No feedback, no improvement.**

Feedback allows you to improve your skills, your relationships, and yourself. You should always approach feedback in a sincere and beneficial manner so that you can learn and grow from it. Keep in mind that it was probably very uncomfortable for this person to step up and give you feedback. Analyze how you can grow from this piece of information. Keep in mind that the person who is giving you feedback might not be very good at doing it, so the message might sound harsher than intended. Don't just reject the feedback because the message was not brought to you well -- there is always something you can learn. This is especially true in a multicultural environment like Microverse, where people come from cultures where giving feedback is done differently. Be open, and try to understand, no matter how it's delivered.

**Step 3: Ask follow-up questions to understand the feedback better.**

Try to actively listen. Ask questions with curiosity. Try to avoid sounding judgmental and have an open attitude.

Example questions:

- Can you say more about what you mean when you say...?
- Can you be more specific about what it means to you, and what your expectations are?
- Can you give specific examples of times when I was/wasn’t...?
- What does it look like to you?
- Can you give examples or suggestions of what you think I can do differently to be more...?

**Step 4: Keep in mind that feedback is subjective. It’s always how the other sees you through their lens.**

As we said before, there is always something to learn from a piece of feedback. But that doesn't mean that you have to agree with 100% of the feedback that the person gave. Everyone has their own interpretation of a situation so it can also mean that they are missing some information.

For example:

If your manager tells you that they feel like you are not motivated because you have been not as productive. It can be that that week someone in your family is very sick that requires your attention.

Your manager doesn't know that, so you can explain that there was something requiring some of your attention, but that going forward you will communicate better what is happening in your life if it impacts your work.

**Step 5: Make sure to distinguish between constructive and destructive feedback**.

Constructive feedback is when someone gives you feedback with the goal of improving your behavior. Destructive feedback is when someone gives you feedback with the goal of bringing you down and hurting you as a person.

Most of the time, feedback here will be constructive. Micronauts actively support one another and try to help each other improve. But sometimes, it may feel like someone is just trying to bring you down. If this happens to you, try not to let it get to you. You may find it helpful to talk with other Micronauts about it, or get help from Student Success.

**Step 6: Thank the giver for their feedback!**

Feedback can save you from possible pitfalls down the road. This person just invested in you by providing you with feedback so remember to thank them!
