## Learning objectives

- Learn how to use communication and cross-cultural knowledge as tools when conflicts arise in working relationships.
- Learn the value of active listening as a teamwork and feedback skill.
- Understand that respect is the foundation of strong relationship-building with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.*

**Spend 5 minutes on this section individually**

How good are you now in giving and receiving feedback? Are you kind and respectful when giving it? Do you analyze and listen to the feedback when receiving it?

In this Morning Session, we will practice more on this topic and you will assess how good you are at giving and receiving feedback.

### Why is giving and receiving feedback important?

Feedback is everywhere: At Microverse for example, you will give and receive feedback from your coding partners. In your future workplace, you will also give and receive feedback from your manager and team members. Giving or receiving feedback in a non-constructive manner can seriously damage the relationship between you and the other person. This is why it is important to do this in a constructive way so that the feedback is productive and the relationship stays strong.

### Refresher on giving and receiving feedback

In the lesson *"Fundamentals of giving and receiving feedback,*" you learned what feedback is, and how to give and receive feedback. Here is a quick refresher from that lesson.
