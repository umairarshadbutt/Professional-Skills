*Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

"Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration (sweat)." This well-known quote by the famous inventor Thomas Edison is a reminder that most important achievements don't just happen; they take hard work.  So, why are we so easily convinced when we are told that we won't be able to succeed at something based on our age, gender, or background? This is part of a **fixed mindset**. To overcome challenges, we need to learn to develop a **growth mindset**.

### Why is it important to have a growth mindset?

We all face challenges and we all make mistakes. When we learn to ride a bicycle, we may start with a tricycle or training wheels to help keep us steady. We may even fall off a few times before we learn to stay upright and ride for miles. Throughout those early learning stages, we need to remind ourselves (and be reassured by others) that **we will be able to ride a bike.** We need to remain confident that we can grow and learn. That same **growth mindset** is also a key part of what is needed as we face new challenges in our educational journeys and in our careers.
