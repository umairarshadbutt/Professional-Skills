# Practicing proactive communication

Proactive communication is when you prevent problems instead of fixing them. You answer questions before they’re asked. You deal with complaints before they’re made. You work with your audiences to discuss the issues important to you (and them). Proactive communication is planned, flexible, and delivers on objectives.

Proactive communication increases productivity by improving working relationships with colleagues, saving you time on back-and-forth communication, and mitigating problems. 

There are a few simple steps you can take to move towards a more proactive method of communication: 

- Provide updates and project status without being asked.

    Keeping your colleagues and team members up to date with your schedule and how a project is progressing shows responsibility and helps to build trust and loyalty. If you are in a morning session with your group and working through an individual section, you would want to let the group know when you have either completed the solo activity or any challenges you may have faced with the activity. 

- Report any unusual activity or challenge.

    Unusual activities can range from a development bug to a minor typographical error. Occasionally, it may take a longer time to determine the root cause of an issue, but bringing up issues can prevent the problem from having a deeper impact. In a morning session with your group, you are asked to fill a form, for example, and notice the form submission button isn't working. Proactive communication involves bringing that up with the group as soon as you notice and no one else has reported. 

- Commend team members and celebrate exciting results.

    Celebrating exciting results can be motivating and builds team morale. It can unlock opportunities for others in the group to learn something new. In a morning session, completing a task or finding the solution to a tough task helps to share congratulatory messages to celebrate the result. Follow up with a brief couple of minutes of questions that allow the celebrant to explain their solution to the group. If it's a team effort and solution, congratulate each for a few minutes and talk about your challenges about the task. 

- Share suggestions and ideas.

    Ideas don't always pop into our minds and sometimes need time to think through, but when they do in a group discussion, it is important to share them boldly. Summarise the idea in a couple of sentences, then give brief context and explanation during your morning session. Trust that there is always value in sharing an idea. 

There are many ways you can engage in proactive communication and develop trust with your colleagues, and these are just a few. Practice these methods during your morning sessions and group projects, and remember to give yourself time and grace to make mistakes and learn from them.
