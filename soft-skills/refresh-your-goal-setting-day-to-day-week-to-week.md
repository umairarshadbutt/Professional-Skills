# Refresh your goal setting day-to-day, week to week

## Learning objectives

- Create a plan to use these goal setting tools to develop good habits.
- Create a good SMART goal for a weekly goal.
- Create a good SMART goal for a daily goal.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to increase your knowledge of how to break your big-picture goals into smaller manageable tasks to achieve your daily and weekly goals. 

### Why is day-to-day and week-to-week goal-setting important?

Without having smaller, daily goals that will give you a sense of accomplishment on a regular basis, you will lose the necessary motivation to reach your big-picture goals.

Setting small process goals that you can complete in one day allows you to take a more active approach in goal-setting because it keeps you moving forward and making progress in between those milestone moments when you attain your bigger, more life-changing goals.

### How to set effective day-to-day and week-to-week goals

**Guiding questions:**
