# What is good feedback?

Good feedback should check the following boxes:

- **It is open and respectful**: Giving feedback is a common route to starting arguments if the recipient believes they are being condescended to. It is important that when you give feedback, you are letting the recipient know that this is an open conversation about how to improve your working relationship, not a scolding. Focus on how their work performance or behavior makes you feel to make it easier for them to empathize with you and reduce the chances of getting defensive.
- **It is fact-based and not subjective**: Constructive feedback should be something objectively true, not an opinion where reasonable minds can disagree. Critiquing someone's design choice by saying the button should be red instead of orange might not be very helpful, but citing accessibility guidelines about proper use of color and contrast would be a good way to offer fact-based constructive feedback that isn't subjective. Bear in mind that you might not have all the facts or the full context, which is another reason why an open and respectful conversation is so important.
- **It is kind, but direct**: People get nervous when receiving feedback. You should empathize with them and make them feel safe when they receive your feedback by avoiding long opening statements, preamble, tangents, or stalling before getting to the point.

## Example of good and bad feedback

Here's an example of feedback that doesn't incorporate the above principles very well: *"Well first of all I really enjoy working with you, and during our last project I thought we did some great work together. Your CSS skills are great and I was impressed how you helped us unwind that merge conflict the other day. However the way you keep fiddling with your phone is really annoying and you need to stop because it is incredibly unprofessional."*

There are several problems with that feedback:

- It isn't direct. It doesn't get straight to the point right at the start and goes on a long tangent, during which time your teammate or partner is getting nervous and wondering what the feedback will be.
- It is hostile rather than kind. There are better ways to tell someone their phone distractions are creating problems for your collaboration than to say that it's really annoying.
- It is disrespectful and shuts down conversation. Don't tell your partner or teammate that they need to stop doing something because it is incredibly unprofessional. This will make them feel scolded and condescended to. And it certainly doesn't foster an open conversation about what's going on.

Here's a better version of that same feedback: *"I think the most important thing for you to work on is improving your focus when we meet. Seeing you get distracted by your phone while we're trying to collaborate frustrates me and impedes our productivity. What do you think we can do to make it easier for you to stay focused when we're working together? I really enjoy working with you and I think with greater focus we would be even more effective together."*

This is better for the following reasons:

- It is direct. The main point is in the first sentence.
- It is kind. This feedback gets across how you're feeling accurately without being mean about it.
- It is respectful and promotes conversation. By asking the recipient what they think can be done to resolve the issue, this feedback feels less like a lecture and more like a conversation about how to move forward together.
