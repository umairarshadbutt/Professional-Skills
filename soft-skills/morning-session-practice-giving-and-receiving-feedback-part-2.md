# Morning Session: Practice giving and receiving feedback part 2

## Learning objectives

- Recognize and practice receiving constructive feedback as a gift and an opportunity for growth.

### Estimated time: .5h

## Practice receiving feedback

In this activity, you will get a chance to practice the best practices around receiving and responding to feedback from other members of your team.

### Why is it important to receive feedback well?

In order for us to get better at what we do, we need to receive constructive feedback from those we work with and hone our skills at incorporating that feedback into our work. This helps us make steady improvements in our personal performance and professional relationships.

**Guiding questions:**

- How do you feel about receiving feedback?
- What should you do if you get feedback that feels mean-spirited or very negative?
