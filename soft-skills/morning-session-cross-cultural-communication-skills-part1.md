# Morning session: Cross-cultural communication skills - part 1

## Learning objectives

- Learn how to use communication and cross-cultural knowledge as tools when conflicts arise in working relationships.
- Understand how to communicate across cultures, using empathy and curiosity and actively questioning own biases.
- Understand that respect is the foundation of strong relationship-building with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

### Understanding cross-cultural communication

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

We all see the world a little differently. Sometimes the places and cultures in which we grew up or currently live. can affect how we see things. Different points of view can sometimes lead to disagreements or conflicts. 

### Why is understanding cross-cultural communication differences important?

Microverse cohorts include students from many different countries and cultures. This is not unlike the diversity that you may encounter when working on a team in a multinational company, or even just within a company in your own country. Being aware of these differences, especially related to communication, can help us to be more empathetic and understanding, and allow us to better manage conflicts that may arise. 

### Recognizing different communication styles

Guiding questions:

- How can miscommunication cause conflicts in groups?
- How can empathy help to avoid conflicts related to communication?

### Group discussion

*Spend 10 minutes on this section as a group*

As a group, watch this video about [direct and indirect communication styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W9iLrfyq20). Discuss which communication style is more common in your culture. Is that the same style that you also tend to use personally?
