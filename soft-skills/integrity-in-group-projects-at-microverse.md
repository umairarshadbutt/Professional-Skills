# Integrity in group projects at Microverse

Integrity in teamwork means doing the work you have agreed to do. It means that your team members can trust that you will show up and follow through on what is expected of them as best as possible. Being someone reliable and trustworthy in these ways is about having a strong work ethic. Having a strong work ethic is very important to be a successful software developer.

## Why it's important to contribute equally

Contributing equally to a group project will bring the best result as you will have diverse input to the project from all the different members. As each person delivers the work when it was expected there are no unexpected blockers or surprises. Members who can count on each other will also be more eager to help each other if one person gets stuck. By equally contributing you are investing in positive working relationships and a strong network.

## Cheating in group projects

Cheating with teamwork often takes the form of not doing your part of the work or doing very little of it while taking credit for the work of others. This can cause a lot of conflict within a team. On the one hand, it will cause conflict due to team members counting on you and when they find out you did not deliver, they will have to put in extra work unexpectedly or they might miss a deadline. On the other hand, team members do not want someone who didn't put in the effort to take credit for their hard work.

Cheating in teamwork can lead to other negative consequences besides conflict. Team members will no longer want to collaborate with you. It can also harm your reputation in the long run. If a team member gets hired by a company that is looking to hire more Micronauts, your team member will recommend against hiring you if you took credit for their work! So it could cost you a job opportunity.

## How do we assess equal contributions at Microverse?

To assess equal contribution in group projects, all team members will fill out a form that assesses each team member's contribution to the project. You will also report on your own perception of your contribution. If all team members assess that one person did not contribute to the project, that person will fail the project and will have to repeat it.
