# What to do during and after the virtual coffee meeting

### During the virtual coffee meeting

Like any professional meeting, be sure to minimize background noise and dress professionally. Be sure to have your list of questions ready and take notes. 

Remember, networking is a long-term investment and if you reach out to someone you don't know and ask for something right away, it can make the other person feel used. Listen attentively and don't ask for a connection to a job yet. Right now, your only objective is to learn and build your network. 

### After the virtual coffee meeting

Send them an immediate message thanking them for their time and the valuable information you learned. 

Refer to your notes and reflect on the conversation and ask yourself if there is something you can help them with right now. Example: If they were talking about a specific challenge they were facing, can you share a recent blog post you recently read (or wrote) that might help them?

Finally, ask if it's okay if you keep in touch. Then, set a reminder in your Google Calendar to follow up with them in a month.
