# Cross-cultural collaboration at Microverse

As we have a lot of diversity due to the different cultures and countries at Microverse, different comments and actions may be interpreted differently. So when you say something that you did not mean to be harmful or sexual, it might be interpreted as sexual or harmful. For example, while in some countries it's accepted to comment on someone's appearance in the workplace, in other cultures this is highly unaccepted. In the global remote workplace, the norm is NOT to do this, so we expect you to avoid commenting on appearance at Microverse too.

To avoid misunderstanding, miscommunication, and conflict, try to keep your communication professional by focusing on the task you are working on. Of course, sometimes we have more casual conversations between partners and groups that are not related to code.
