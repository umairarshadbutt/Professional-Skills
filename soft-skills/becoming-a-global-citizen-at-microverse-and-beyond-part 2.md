## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ongoing knowledge of the Code of Conduct and how to seek help if you see breaches in it.
- Understand how age, gender and religion in the workplace is viewed in different cultures.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Using a Code of Conduct to respect differences

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

As mentioned in [Becoming a global citizen at Microverse and beyond  (part 1)](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/soft-skills/becoming-a-global-citizen-at-microverse-and-beyond-part1.md), the code of conduct helps everyone at Microverse understand how they are expected to treat each other. Take a look back at the *[Microverse Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-fb637972fe434dccb1004fd572007a59)* and your own previous exercise to remember some of the expected and unacceptable behaviors mentioned. 

### Why is it important to recognizing and addressing unacceptable behavior

The Microverse Code of Conduct mentions that you should "trust that your mentors, peers, code reviewers, and Microverse staff have the best intentions in mind." Still, even with the best of intentions, we all sometimes make mistakes. When someone has demonstrated behavior that does not seem to follow the spirit of the code of conduct, it can be challenging to determine how to address it.

**Guiding questions:**

- How might we recognize if someone has demonstrated unacceptable behavior?
- How can we use a Code of Conduct to help us in uncomfortable situations?
