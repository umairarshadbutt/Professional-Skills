## Introduction

In this lesson, we discuss the importance of diversity and the skills required to work in a multi-cultural environment.

### Why is this important?

As you work with many diverse students, you must understand the active role you play in creating a safe and inclusive environment where all students can contribute. Working with students from different cultures also requires a specific set of collaboration skills. These skills will help you be successful in the Microverse curriculum and will allow you to get ahead of the competition in the global job market since cross-cultural collaboration is a skill that employers highly value.

### Learning about diversity:

### In what ways are people different?

There are so many differences between people it can be hard to know where to begin to understand them better. To foster cross-cultural collaboration, we have found that there are two helpful tools: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and High Context vs Low Context communication.

### Diversity & inclusion policy at Microverse: 

At Microverse, we have a policy to set expectations about the norms here and what is expected of you in this diverse environment. This is called the [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Code-of-Conduct-fb637972fe434dccb1004fd572007a59) and we have an accompanying document outlining our commitment to [diversity, equity and inclusion](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Diversity-equity-inclusion-6ee649cedd344727908b80d83a529d9f). The most important things to keep in mind are:

- Be respectful
- Be open-minded and always assume good intentions
- [Report](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500007989921-Report-violations-of-the-Code-of-Conduct) any behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable or is inappropriate
