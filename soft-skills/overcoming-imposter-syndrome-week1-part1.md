### Why is this important?

Imposter Syndrome is very common and even more so with software developers. The goal of sharing these videos is to help understand in what way imposter syndrome impacts other people. This is to help you understand that having doubts about your competencies is very normal! Everyone has them and it's what makes you human. It's also a sign that you are doing something difficult that requires hard work to achieve. You should be very proud that you are doing this.
