# Morning Session: Communication through conflict takes practice - part 1

## Learning objectives

- Recall and apply best practices for communicating when conflicts arise with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

**Spend 10 minutes on this section individually**

In this morning session, you will learn how to practice communicating in conflict situations.

### Why is communicating through conflict important?

Because it is one thing to know the rules of communicating through conflict, and it is another thing to be able to put it into action. Conflict raises a lot of emotion, uncertainty, and fear and this is why most of us try to avoid conflict situations. However, these situations do happen simply because we are human so it is important to practice dealing with conflict situations.
