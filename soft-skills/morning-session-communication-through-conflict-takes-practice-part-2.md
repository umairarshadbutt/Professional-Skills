# Morning Session: Communication through conflict takes practice - part 2

## Learning objectives

- Recall and apply best practices for communicating when conflicts arise with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

**Spend 5 minutes on this section individually**

In this morning session, you will learn about different personality types and how to reduce conflict when working with people of different personality types.

### Why is communicating through conflict important?

Since we are all different, we will have different ideas, behaviors, and thoughts. Because of these differences, conflict situations can arise when we come together to work in a team so it is important to understand our differences so we can work well together.

### Understanding our differences using the DISC self-assessment

DISC is a behavior assessment tool that will help you better understand your behavior as well as the behaviors of your team members. The tool explains that there are 4 main personality types and each human being falls into at least one of these categories:

- D - Dominance
- I - Influence
- S - Steadiness
- C - Conscientiousness

In the exercise below, you will learn about these 4 personality types, get to know which type resonates most with you, and learn how to work with others who show different personality types.
