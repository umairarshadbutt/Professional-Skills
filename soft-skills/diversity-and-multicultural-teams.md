# Diversity and Multicultural Teams

At Microverse, we have people from all over the world. Therefore we have a lot of diversity. We hear this word a lot, but what does it mean? Here is a definition:

> The diversity definition refers to the existence of variations of different characteristics in a group of people. These characteristics could be everything that makes us unique, such as our cognitive skills and personality traits, along with the things that shape our identity (e.g. race, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, cultural background). - workable

As you can see, diversity refers to a lot of different characteristics like race, gender, cognitive skills, and so on. A challenge that diverse teams often face is creating an atmosphere of inclusion where members feel accepted, heard, and included. What helps diverse teams be successful is when **each team member takes an active role** in creating an inclusive environment.

> Inclusion means to embrace all people irrespective of their race, gender, disability, medical or other needs. It is about giving equal access and opportunities and getting rid of discrimination and intolerance. It affects all aspects of public life. - [Inclusion.me](http://inclusion.me)

Diversity brings a lot of benefits to teams and organizations. Also you can gain a lot from working with a diverse group of people. As globalization grows and companies want to invest more in diversity and multicultural teams, the need for talent that can work in a multicultural environment grows too. At Microverse, we value diversity. We believe that everyone has potential and should have the opportunity to participate in the job market. As you'll work with Micronauts from different parts of the world, with different religions, cultures, gender, and so on- you will practice applying the skills needed to create an inclusive environment.
