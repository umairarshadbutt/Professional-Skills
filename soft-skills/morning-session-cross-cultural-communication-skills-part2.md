# Morning session: Cross-cultural communication skills - part 2

## Learning objectives

- Learn how to use communication and cross-cultural knowledge as tools when conflicts arise in working relationships.
- Understand how to communicate across cultures, using empathy and curiosity and actively questioning own biases.
- Understand that respect is the foundation of strong relationship-building with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Dealing with conflict in cross-cultural situations

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

In the previous session, we talked about conflicts that can occur due to misunderstandings in communication styles. Recognizing and understanding differences can help us minimize conflicts; however, some conflicts will still inevitably occur and it's important to think about how to handle them.

### Why is dealing with conflict in cross-cultural situations important?

Dealing with conflict is not easy. Sometimes people just try to ignore the issue and hope that problems will get resolved on their own. This usually does not work; the problems don't go away and they can often get worse. While it's important to deal with conflict, **how** we deal with it is critical to maintaining effective team relationships and a healthy work environment. 

### Recognizing different communication styles

Guiding questions:

- What are healthy ways of dealing with conflicts?
- What strategies can be used to help with difficult conversations?

**Learn more about how to handle conflict in the workplace:**
