# Working with a diverse team: Part 2

## Learning objectives:

- Demonstrate ability to work successfully with diverse team members.
- Explain some of the key factors needed to create a comfortable working environment for teammates.
- Show familiarity with diversity and inclusion policy at Microverse and expectations for openness and respect.

### Estimated time: 0.5hr

## Description:

This lesson talks about cultural stereotypes and the effects that they may have at Microverse or later at the workplace.

### Why is this important?

Stereotypes are harmful because it leads us to make conclusions about individuals that are often not true. In the workplace, this may lead to discrimination. At Microverse we have a lot of students from all over the world. Having so many differences between each other might lead to more stereotypes existing between us. Learning and being aware of cultural stereotypes will help us question and disregard them so that we can see the individual and their capabilities instead of the stereotype.

### Cultural stereotypes
