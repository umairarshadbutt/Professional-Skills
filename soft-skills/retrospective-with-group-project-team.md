### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Looking back to move ahead

In our busy lives, we can get so focused on moving forward and getting things done that we forget to give ourselves time to think about how we got there. It is helpful to stop and reflect on what has happened. A retrospective (or debrief) after a project can provide that opportunity for reflection. Here at Microverse, we ask you to do a retrospective following group projects as a best practice during the program, and to prepare you for the final capstone, where you will be assessed on your team collaboration by a mock interviewer.

### Why is reflection important?

It's hard to really understand a situation when it's happening. When working in a group, each person may experience these situations in different ways. By reflecting together, we can better understand these different experiences and work to find ways to move forward more effectively as a group. A debrief session should be seen as an opportunity to both identify areas for improvement and celebrate areas of success.

### The power of positive feedback

We all have both strengths and weaknesses. It's just as important for people to leverage their strengths as it is for them to work on their weaknesses.  While we are often quick to provide feedback to others when there is a problem, we can forget to let people know when they’ve done something well — especially things that had a positive impact on us individually. In addition to the positive impact this feedback can have on the person **receiving** it, it can also make those **giving** the feedback [feel happier themselves](https://www.success.com/4-science-backed-reasons-gratitude-brings-you-happiness/). 

**Guiding questions:**

- What are the benefits of giving and getting positive feedback at work?
- How can we share positive feedback with team members?
