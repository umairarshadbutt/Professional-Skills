# Icebreaker questions to get to know each other

A common practice in the remote work environment is icebreaker questions. They serve the purpose of having a few informal minutes at the beginning of the meeting that allows you to get to know your colleague better. An icebreaker question is a question that can be about any topic that is non-work related that "breaks the ice" at the beginning of the meeting. The answers to these kinds of questions must be short, so they don't take up much time in the meeting. Ice breaker questions generally should not take more than 5-10 minutes of the meeting.

### **Some examples of ice breaker questions:**

- What was your first job?
- How old were you when you first heard about software development?
- Do you prefer reading or watching movies?
- If you could pick up a new skill in an instant what would it be?
