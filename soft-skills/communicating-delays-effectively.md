# Communicating delays effectively

# How to communicate delays effectively as a time management best practice.

The above time management skills are to be practiced regularly to improve and achieve your goals. However, there are days when you might not be able to complete a task due to a personal situation outside of your control or a reasonable professional situation! Maybe the task is larger than you estimated or you ran into a technical issue you're struggling to solve. On days like these, communicating effectively with your coding partners, colleagues, manager, or anyone else monitoring or involved in the project is important. 

Here are some practical ways to recognise and communicate delays: 

- **Recognize and acknowledge that a situation is beyond your control or the task is beyond your capacity.** An example could be an electricity/power issue or a bad connectivity/internet issue that cannot be resolved within a significant time-frame without impacting your schedule. It could also be a health-related issue or a family emergency. Whatever the situation may be, ensure to have an awareness of it.
- **Estimate how long the delay could last and proactively consider the impact of the delay.** An example would be estimating that a nation-wide internet disruption would last for 24 hours, and proactively checking if you would miss your deadline with a 24 hour delay.
- **Be honest and transparent, and continue to make communication a top priority.** Use the given or recommended communication tools to update and stay in touch with relevant parties, including your coding partner and the Student Success team. Asynchronous communication will be helpful in cases like this. See below for links on the difference between synchronous and asynchronous remote work.
