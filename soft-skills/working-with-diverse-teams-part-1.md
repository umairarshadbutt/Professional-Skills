## Sexual Harassment:

In this lesson, we explain what sexual harassment is and give examples of what constitutes sexual harassment. You will do the first part of this lesson individually on the call with your Morning Session Group and then discuss as a group in the second half.

### Why is this important?

Sexual harassment can cause a person to feel uncomfortable and unsafe. It impacts a person's morale, productivity, and motivation. In turn, it impacts the person's ability to learn. Sexual harassment can come in many different forms. Common types of sexual harassment include:

- Jokes,
- Compliments about someone's appearance, and
- Sexual comments.

In the workplace, sexual harassment is taken very seriously and can result in work termination and even legal action. At Microverse, we are committed to creating a safe learning environment for all students, by helping every one of you understand how to behave in a professional environment and what to do if you encounter sexual harassment.

Put simply, sexual harassment is any type of comment, suggestion, question, or behavior that has the potential to make the other student feel uncomfortable. At Microverse, we have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. Any behavior as such can result in expulsion. If you have experienced sexual harassment, reach out to Student Success immediately.

### Examples of sexual harassment

Please take a look at the section "Examples of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace" in the following article to find more examples of what counts as sexual harassment. Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive list. Some things can count as sexual harassment even if at a first glance the comment does not look sexual at all. The context is important to take into consideration.
