### Estimated time: 0.5 h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what virtual coffee meetings are and the advantages they can offer. You will also learn how to get the most value out of a virtual coffee meeting, specifically focusing on what to do before, during, and after the meeting. 

### Why is setting up a virtual coffee important?

Setting up a virtual coffee is a fantastic way to network! It gives you the opportunity to learn, teach, and meet other developers and hiring managers you likely would never have met otherwise.

### Before the virtual coffee meeting

First, you'll need to find some professionals working in the industry to invite to your meeting. If you're wondering who to ask, here is a list of ideas:

- An experienced developer who works at a company you're interested in
- A remote developer working internationally
- A senior developer or technical team lead who attended a coding bootcamp

**How to find someone**

You can reach out to people you have already met in Slack or MeetUp groups or you can use LinkedIn's search feature to find relevant professionals on LinkedIn. Watch [this short 2-minute Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/824e9413b9d9413f90f43ef8ee7dca8b) to learn how.  

Keep in mind that if they aren't job-seeking themselves, they probably aren't logging in that often. You can look in the Contact or About section for an email address and if it's not there, read [6 Ways To Find Anyoneâ€™s Email Address in 2021 (Tried & Tested)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/find-email-address/)  for some great tips. 

**How to invite someone to your virtual coffee meeting**

Most people are genuinely flattered by these requests and like to help, so don't be afraid to contact people you've never met. The most important thing is to show a genuine interest in the person. If you ask for a referral into their company or ask if they know about any open jobs, they will likely ignore your request.
