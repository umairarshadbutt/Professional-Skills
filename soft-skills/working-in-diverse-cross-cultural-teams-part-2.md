# Working in diverse cross-cultural teams part 2

### Learning objectives

- Recognize different forms of bias that exist in the world and how they might come into play in Microverse or other professional environments.
- Recognize different types of diversity and worldviews that exist in the world and recognize own worldview in relation to others.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

Cultures around the world communicate in different ways that are more and less direct. This is called high context and low-context communication and this lesson talks more about it.

### Why are high- and low-context cultures important?

There are two very distinct patterns to how people communicate around the world. People who communicate in high-context cultures expect their listeners to "read between the lines" and don't say things as directly. Those from low-context cultures will tend to say things more directly from the beginning. Some Micronauts might use high-context communications whereas others might use low-context communication. The differences can cause miscommunication. When collaborating with someone, identifying and talking about your context culture can help avoid misunderstanding and foster collaboration.

### High- and low-context cultures

The following materials explain the two different types of cultures and show some examples. While listening to the video pay attention if you can identify whether you are high- or low- context culture.

Guiding questions:

- Are you from a high-context or low-context culture?
- How do you think these differences can result in misunderstanding or conflict?

Please watch the video and read the article below individually while staying in the call with your team:

- [Leadership speaker Erin Meyer: Low context vs. high context societies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oYfhTC9lIQ)
- [Example of difference between high context and low context communication](examples-of-differences-between-high-context-and-low-context-communication.md)

### Discussion

Please discuss the following questions with your teammembers:

- Are you from a high-context or low-context culture?
- How do you think these differences can result into misunderstanding or conflict?
- What else comes to mind for you?
