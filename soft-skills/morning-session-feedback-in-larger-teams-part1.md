### Why is feedback in larger teams important?

Because when working in teams, we are working with people who have different personalities, viewpoints, and ways of doing things. To efficiently work together in a team setting, we need to be able to give positive and constructive feedback to each other so that everyone can learn from the feedback, learn how to work better together, and thus improve the project's advancement.
