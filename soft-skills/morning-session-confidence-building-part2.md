### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Introduction

The importance of this lesson is to learn the required skills in recognizing low-self esteem and maintaining confidence in the workplace. 

### Why is confidence-building important?

Everyone admires a self-confident person. We may even envy them a little! Self-confident people seem at ease with themselves and their work. They invite trust and inspire confidence in others. These are attractive characteristics.

It's not always easy to be confident in yourself, particularly if you're naturally self-critical, or if other people put you down. But there are steps that you can take to increase and maintain your self-confidence.

### Building self-confidence

*Read through this next section individually for five minutes, but stay on the Zoom call with your group.*
