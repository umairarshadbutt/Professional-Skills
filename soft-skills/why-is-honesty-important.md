# Why is honesty important?

Michael Josephson, a wise expert on ethics in the workplace, once said that "honesty doesn't always pay, but dishonesty always costs.” What did he mean? Being the person working honestly may mean more effort, it may mean things take longer or cost more. When things are really difficult—as a student, in the workplace—cheating can feel like an easy way to get to the end goal faster. But as Josephson says, it always has a cost. It will leave you not understanding the content fully as a student. It could get you fired from a job if discovered in the workplace, or worse if the dishonesty extends to something illegal.

It may seem obvious to say honesty is important. Of course, we shouldn't cheat! But when it comes to the day-to-day of working it can feel less clear. There might be difficult moments where you don't know what you're doing. There may be tempting opportunities to cut corners or cheat that don't seem like they would hurt anyone. Especially when people are new to something, they may feel overwhelmed and decide cheating feels easier.

But honesty is important even if it doesn't immediately get you anything. Employers, other students and the Microverse staff want you to be a reliable team member who they can trust. If you get caught lying once, that trust is broken and sometimes cannot be rebuilt.
