# How to personalize your pitch in order to build rapport with your audience

Before you start personalizing your elevator pitch, ask yourself these questions:

1. What are my audience's values or goals?
2. What is my audience interested in?
3. What does my audience need help with?
4. Why is what my audience does so important?
5. What makes your audience different from anyone else?

Use the answer to these questions to write 1-2 sentences about why you personally feel that your audience is special. Let's look at a few examples:

### Bad examples

"*I like your company because you build high quality products and are committed to excellence."*

*"Your company would be a great way for me to gain more experience."*

*"I'm interested in finding a mentor and I saw you on LinkedIn."*

### Why are these examples bad?

These examples are poor for two main reasons:

1. **They could apply to any company/organization/person on earth**. Every company claims to deliver high quality products; using this type of sentence just shows your audience that you don't actually care enough about them to do any research.
2. **They're about you, not the audience.** Remember: if all you talk about is yourself, your audience will think you only care about yourself. Your goal is to show that you care about them.

### Good examples

*"I've been using X app since my senior year of college; X app is probably the main reason I passed organic chemistry. I'd love to have a chance to contribute to the team and help you the way you helped me."*

*"I saw the talk you gave at Y Conference last month on state machines, and I've been buried in research ever since."*

*"The work that Z company is doing with cryptocurrency and real estate has the potential to completely revolutionize the housing market and make homeownership more affordable for so many people just like me--and I want in!*

*"I've spent the last several months working remotely and asynchronously with people across five different time zones, so when I read your post on LinkedIn about X-company looking for experienced remote devs, I immediately saw myself in the job description."*

### Why are these examples good?

These examples are strong because they are **about the audience**. In other words:

1. **They are \*specific\* to the audience**. The first example explains how the speaker has used the audience's specific app for years. The second example mentioned a specific speech the audience gave. The third example shows that the speaker has a strong understanding of what Z company does and why it's important.
2. They focus on **what the audience has done.** The speaker mentions themselves only to draw a connection with the speakers; the focus of these examples is on the audience's product, the audience's conference, or the audience's purpose.

When writing your personal elevator pitch, **pick a company, person, or audience you'd like to use as a make-believe audience.** Here are some examples you can use:

- The CEO of a tech company you admire
- A recruiter on LinkedIn who just said they're looking for remote software developers, specifically for an education technology company
- An entrepreneur building a project you think could be exciting
- Anyone else!
