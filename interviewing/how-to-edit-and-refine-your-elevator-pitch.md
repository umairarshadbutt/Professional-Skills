# **How to edit and refine your elevator pitch**

Now that you've finished writing your elevator pitch, it's time to edit and refine.

### **Check for spelling and grammar**

1. In Google Docs, go to Tools >> Spelling and Grammar >> Spelling and Grammar Check. Review every update that Google Doc provides you.
2. Make sure that your Grammarly extension is turned on (and all the toggles are checked on), and then review your Google Doc using Grammarly, too.
3. Read your elevator pitch aloud to catch any errors that spellcheck may not have noticed (for example, Google Docs might not notice if you type "word" instead of "world").
4. Make sure that **any named technologies are correctly capitalized** (such as CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

### **Make sure you use varying sentence types**

If every sentence in your elevator pitch starts the same way or follows the same format, your pitch is always going to sound robotic. Read the following sentences aloud as an example:

"*My name is Maria. I am a software developer. I specialize in building mobile apps for gaming companies. I spent the last year working remotely at a Fortune-500 company that creates games aimed at teenagers. I was named Employee of the Month for 6 months running. I'd love to chat with you."*

Nearly every sentence of that pitch begins the same way: "I did this," or "I am that." In addition, the elevator pitch relies entirely on simple sentences. Here's a better example:

*"My name is Maria. I'm a software developer who specializes in building mobile apps for gaming companies. My latest work experience was at a Fortune-500 company, where I worked as lead developer on XYZ, a mobile app aimed at 13- to 18-year-olds. 5 million downloads and counting! I've spent my entire career chasing after one challenge after another, and when I saw Gizmodo highlight your company last week and started doing research, I immediately knew I'd be able to help you all out. Would you be available to chat next week about the position?"*

Not only is the second pitch stronger, it also just *sounds* better; it uses a mixture of short sentences and long ones, and not every single sentence starts with the word "I."
