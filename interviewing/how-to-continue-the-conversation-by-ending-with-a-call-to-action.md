# **How to continue the conversation by ending with a call to action**

Every pitch should end with a call to action; this increases the chance of subsequent conversations, and is a powerful way of improving your networking success. Some calls to action work better than others, though. We'll review a few examples of strong CTAs and weak ones, and then discuss what makes each strong or not.

### Bad examples

*"Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn."*

*"Can you tell me how to apply to your company?"*

"*Take a look at my portfolio if you're interested."*

### Why are these examples bad?

These examples are bad because they **don't do a good job of continuing the dialogue**. If you simply ask your audience to connect with you on LinkedIn, they'll probably connect with you and then move on entirely. If you ask them how to apply to a company, they'll probably just refer you to their online jobs page. If you ask them to look at your portfolio, they'll probably bookmark it and then forget.

Instead, focus on specifics. Let's look at some strong examples.

### Good examples

*"I'd love to schedule a 15-minute Zoom call to talk about XYZ. Would you have some time next week?"*

*"I'm working on a project using XState, and I'd love your opinion. Could you sit down with me for a few minutes to give me ideas for improvement?"*

*"If you have free time now, I'd love to buy you a coffee and ask a few questions about your career trajectory."*

### Why are these examples good?

The examples above are strong because they end with a **short, reasonable ask.** The call to action is a way of saying that you understand that their time is valuable, and you'd appreciate being able to borrow a few minutes of their time to continue the conversation.

The call to action is the last sentence of your elevator pitch.
