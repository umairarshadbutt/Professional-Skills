# Why are elevator pitches so useful?

The term "elevator pitch" comes from the idea that it should be short enough to share within the span of an elevator ride: when you only have a brief opportunity to introduce yourself, after all, you need to be able to communicate the most important information in a succinct, persuasive way. In order to do so, you need to have something prepared.

Some of you reading might stop here and say, "the chances of randomly meeting someone in an elevator who wants to hire developers is pretty small. Why should I bother making an entire pitch?"

The answer is because **elevator pitches are used for more than just in-person networking**. Here's a few examples of when an elevator pitch is useful:

- **Networking on LinkedIn**. LinkedIn limits the number of characters you can use when messaging a prospective connection. In other words, being able to write something short but persuasive is incredibly important.
- **Applying to software development jobs on AngelList**. Every time you apply to a job on AngelList, you're asked to include a short intro message. A good elevator pitch is what's going to get a recruiter to look at your application.
- **Introducing yourself in emails**. If you're reaching out to someone new, you need to grab their attention immediately; otherwise, they'll probably ignore your email entirely. Use the first paragraph of your email to give your elevator pitch: that will help interest your new connection enough to keep reading the rest of the email.
- **Answering the dreaded "tell me about yourself" question in job interviews**. This is supposed to be a simple question, but it's the question that nearly all candidates have trouble answering. Your elevator pitch makes the perfect answer.

The elevator pitch is incredibly versatile and will be a huge advantage for you, even if you never do end up riding an elevator with a cool startup CEO.
