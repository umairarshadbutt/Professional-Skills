# How to persuasively convey accomplishments and history

You previously wrote about some of your most valuable experiences when [creating your USP in an earlier lesson](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/imposter-syndrome/what-makes-you-unique-define-your-personal-usp.md). Now, let's learn how to refine those sentences to most persuasively showcase what you've accomplished.

We'll first take a look at a few bad examples, and explain why those examples are weak. Afterward, we'll look at stronger examples.

### Bad examples

*"I just finished Microverse, where I built dozens of projects using Rails, React, and Redux."*

*"I worked in the sales industry for a few years before making the switch to computer engineering. Now I'm comfortable working with JavaScript, Ruby, and Rails."*

*"I worked for five years at the Ministry of Education as a software developer. Before that, I graduated from college with a degree in computer engineering."*

### Why are these examples bad?

At first glance, these examples might seem decent. However, they are weak examples for two reasons:

1. **They are not personal or unique.** There is no explanation of what would make the speaker special; in fact, if you attend a tech conference, it's highly likely that several other people would have the exact same pitch.
2. **They provide very little detail or context.** The first example mentions building projects, but doesn't even mention what types of projects. The second example doesn't do anything except list a few languages/frameworks. The third example just lists work and education history, with no mention of the type of work the speaker has done.

Here's a good rule of thumb: if a random developer across your city could write the same exact sentence, you have either not included enough information, or you're not focusing on the right information.

### Good examples

*"I'm currently completing coursework at Microverse, a remote software development that allows devs from all over the world to pair-program and build projects together.  I've spent the last several months completely immersed in remote development, building everything from landing pages to Rails APIs."*

*"I began my career in the sales industry, so I'm definitely familiar with the sort of fast-paced, intense environment found at a lot of software startups. My time in sales was actually what encouraged me towards software development; I got curious about how the SaaS I was selling actually worked and signed up for an online course. I fell in love at "Hello, World.""*

*"I worked for five years at the Ministry of Education as a software developer, where I was the lead developer on a team that led interactive math assessments for secondary schools in two major cities."*

### Why are these examples good?

These examples are good for two major reasons:

1. They're **personal and unique.** No random person at a networking event should have the same elevator pitch that you do.
2. They include **detail and context**: The first example gives context by explaining what Microverse is, and a few of the projects they've built. The second example gives detail on how the speaker transitioned from sales to development. The third example gives detail on a major project the speaker worked on.

You do not need to write something very long; the good examples above are all 1-3 sentences long. But it's important to provide enough detail that it's obvious why your history is unique, and why that history would be useful as a software developer.
