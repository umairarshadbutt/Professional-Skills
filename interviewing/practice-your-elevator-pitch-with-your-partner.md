# Practice your elevator pitch with your partner

## Learning objectives

- Confidently pitch yourself in a short elevator pitch.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will practice reciting your elevator pitch aloud while aiming to sound smooth, natural, and confident.

**Spend 15 minutes maximum on this section of the exercise.**

### Why is practicing your elevator pitch important?

You'll be reciting your pitch in front of interviewers, at tech conferences, and more. Your elevator pitch is often your first impression and a strong elevator pitch can open the door for opportunities. Many of us are awkward and uncomfortable with public speaking and that awkwardness can increase when you're trying to pitch yourself.

By practicing your elevator pitch aloud, you'll grow increasingly confident with the script, and will then be able to focus on sounding more natural.

## Exercise

**Spend 45 minutes maximum on this section of the exercise.**

### Instructions

1. **Time estimated: 5 minutes:** Take 5 minutes to read through your pitch and highlight a keyword to help you remember each paragraph of your pitch. So for example, if your pitch contains 3 paragraphs, you should have 3 keywords. Memorize your keywords and read through your pitch again so you can see how the keywords you chose will help you remember your pitch.
2. **Time estimated: 10 minutes:** Now put the pitch away and stand in front of a mirror. Practice saying your pitch solo by using the keywords you memorized to help you remember important parts of your pitch. Recite your pitch in front of the mirror. If you forget what you wanted to say, take a quick look at your keywords or your pitch and then continue reciting in front of your mirror.
3. **Time estimated: 10 minutes:** Still standing in front of your mirror, recite your pitch with your eyes closed. Recite it while making silly faces, and recite it while smiling. Remember that it doesn't need to be perfect. You will have many more opportunities to practice this.
4. **Time estimated: 5 minutes:** Once you have practiced reciting your pitch, record a video of yourself delivering the elevator pitch. Look at the webcam while speaking, and try not to read directly from the script.
5. **Time estimated: 10 minutes:** Once you've practiced your pitch, **join your partner(s) on Zoom and record yourself reciting your elevator pitch to your partner.** Once you've recited your pitch, ask your partner to provide feedback. **Then stop recording.**
6. **Time estimated: 5 minutes:** Open your copy of the template below and paste the zoom recording of point 6 above showing you reciting your pitch to your partner. Also, write in that document the feedback your partner gave you.
