# Make final changes to the elevator pitch based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Confidently pitch yourself in a short elevator pitch.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from your previous elevator pitch reviews to make final improvements and revisions to your elevator pitch.

## Why is it important to make one last round of revisions before finalizing your elevator pitch?

Now that you've gone through the curriculum and the project revision process, your elevator pitch is likely much stronger than it would have been a few weeks ago. However, before you officially complete this project, you'll undergo one final round of revisions.

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error that could potentially prevent you from delivering successful elevator pitches. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.

Remember: the effort you invest in creating and refining your elevator pitch is an effort that will be repaid once you start job searching. **Put all of your effort into this editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Open up your elevator pitch in Google Docs
- Open all written and numerical elevator pitch feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to finalize your elevator pitch

As we've mentioned previously, the ability to willingly accept feedback and then use that feedback to improve your work is a valuable skill. This skill will serve you now in your studies, in your career, and in your personal life.

Please review the article below once more to ensure that you've memorized our most important tips for using feedback to improve your projects. Once done, you'll be able to use all of the feedback you've received to finalize your elevator pitch.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your elevator pitch meets every requirement of the elevator pitch rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULe_jeJfj38Pm_Aj_jqVkUVyL8E-dJn6inLB1ITcUF8/edit). If you have followed the [elevator pitch curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interviewing/use-your-usp-to-craft-the-first-draft-of-your-elevator-pitch.md), it should do so automatically. 
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again which could delay your progress in the program. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)*

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run your document through Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.
