# Update your Elevator Pitch based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Confidently pitch yourself in a short Elevator Pitch.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to update and improve your elevator pitch further.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start creating your project.*

## Why is it important to update your elevator pitch based on feedback?

Very few people are capable of creating perfect first drafts of anything, much less professional elevator pitches; we all have blind spots, and we all make mistakes. Listening to feedback from others is a fantastic way to become aware of our areas of weakness; once we're aware of those weaknesses, we can then take steps to improve them.

This step of the elevator pitch writing process is used to further refine and polish your elevator pitch, so that you'll have the best chance possible of impressing your listeners when you deliver it.

## Project Setup

- Open up your elevator pitch in Google Docs
- Open the Zendesk ticket with written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your elevator pitch

One of the most important skills you can gain in life is the ability to take constructive criticism for the gift it is, and then use that critique in order to improve your work. As a software developer, your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control; this is normal and is a powerful way of helping us learn more and improve on our projects. As a student at Microverse, the professional skills projects you work on will also undergo project reviews, and you will be expected to use this feedback to catch errors in your work and improve it.

In the link below, we'll discuss a few helpful tips to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your elevator pitch meets every requirement of the elevator pitch rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULe_jeJfj38Pm_Aj_jqVkUVyL8E-dJn6inLB1ITcUF8/edit). If you have followed the [elevator pitch curriculum](use-your-usp-to-craft-the-first-draft-of-your-elevator-pitch.md), it should do so automatically. 
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)*

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run your document through Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.

### Submit your project

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.*

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your exercise.
