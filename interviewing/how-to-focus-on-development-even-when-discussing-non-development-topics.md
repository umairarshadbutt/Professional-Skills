# How to focus on development, even when discussing non-development topics

If you didn't have a background in development before joining Microverse, that's okay. It's awesome! So many developers come from non-development backgrounds! The key is making it obvious **why your background has made you a fantastic developer.**

Here are a few examples to illustrate what we mean:

**BAD:** "I was a social worker for ten years, and then I started learning how to code." **WHY IT'S BAD:** This elevator pitch mentions non-development work, which is fine. However, it doesn't explain why that would work would make someone a good developer.

**AVERAGE:** "I was a social worker for ten years, where I spent every day working with a diverse population of people." **WHY IT'S AVERAGE:** This sentence **implies** that the speaker might be good with cross-cultural communication, but **it doesn't actually say it**.

**GREAT:** "I was a social worker for ten years. I spent every day working with a diverse population of people in a stressful, fast-paced environment, so even before I started working as a developer, I was already a pro at juggling the empathy, communication, and work ethic needed to succeed in the dev world. **WHY IT'S GREAT:** This sentence **explains exactly why** the speaker's experience as a social worker makes them singularly **able to thrive** in software development.

Keep these examples in mind throughout this whole exercise.
