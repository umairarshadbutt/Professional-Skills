# How to introduce yourself clearly and effectively

The introduction to an elevator pitch is simple:

1. Say hello
2. Give your name
3. Give a one-sentence overview of what you do.

If you've ever worked in sales or marketing, you may have heard of a format like this: "My name is [X], and I help [Y] by doing [Z]." That format is a little too sales-y for a software development elevator pitch, but it raises one very important key point: **the purpose of an elevator pitch is to convince someone else that they should talk to you**. You don't have to say "I help [Y] by doing [Z]" directly, but your first sentence should still explain **what you can offer.**

Now that we understand the purpose of an elevator pitch, let's look at a few examples.

### Bad examples

*"I'm Juan, and I'm a software developer. In my last job, I used to..."*

*"My name is Fabiola. After graduating from college five years ago I taught English."*

*"If you're looking for a great developer, I'm your guy!"*

### Why are these examples bad?

None of the examples above give us any detail about what you do as a software developer. There are millions of software developers out there, and hundreds of them competing for each job. Your **very first sentence should immediately grab a person's attention by explaining how you're different.** The examples above don't do that--in fact, the second example doesn't even mention software development at all.

### Good Examples

**Good Examples for Students with Some Prior Development Experience:**

*"Hi! My name is Helena, and I'm a full-stack software engineer who specializes in using Javascript, React, Redux, and Rails to build software solutions for small businesses."*

*"Hello! My name is Luis, and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for UX, UI, and accessibility."*

**Good Examples for Students with No Development Experience:**

*"Hi, friend! I'm Muhammad, and my biggest goal in life is to use software engineering to help environmental organizations change the world, one line of code at a time."*

*"Hello! My name is Ana and I'm a full-stack development student currently enrolled in a remote software development school that uses pair-programming and real-world projects to teach development."*

### Why are these examples good?

The examples above first give the speaker's name, explain that the speaker is a software developer, and then explain **what value the speaker can add to a business or work relationship**.

Helena has experience with multiple languages/frameworks and has built software solutions for small businesses; this would be a great pitch if she were meeting the CEO of an early-stage startup. Luis loves UX, UI, and accessibility; wouldn't he be great at improving old, div-soupy code? Muhammad is passionate about environmentalism: a recruiter at a green energy company would love to meet him. Ana doesn't have much experience yet, but she's enrolled in a school that uses real-world practices like pair-programming to teach development.

**Your introduction will (and should) be different!** But the essence should be the same: introduce yourself, give your job role, and talk about what **specific** value you would add to a business.
