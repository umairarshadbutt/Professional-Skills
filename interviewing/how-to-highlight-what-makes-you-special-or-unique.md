# How to highlight what makes you special or unique

You may already know what makes you special; you may even have come up with a few examples when crafting your USP. If that's the case, copy/paste 1-2 of those unique elements into your elevator pitch. If you did not specifically write about things that make you special when creating your USP, however, here are some examples you may use to get you started:

1. Academic or career awards you've won
2. Hackathons you participated in
3. Goals or deadlines you've met
4. Complex projects you've built
5. Struggles you've overcome
6. Compliments you received from managers, professors, etc.
7. Anything else career-related that makes you smile when you think of it.
8. Personality traits that set you apart (positively) from others in a working environment

Again, we'll examine a few good and bad examples.

### Bad examples

*"I've built dozens of projects over the last several months and have used a variety of languages and frameworks."*

*"I graduated from one of the best colleges in my country and have always gotten positive feedback from managers."*

*"I always overcome every challenge I face, and I love solving complex coding puzzles."*

### Why are these examples bad?

Again, these examples are poor because:

1. **They are not personal and unique**. They could apply to millions of developers around the world: every developer builds multiple projects in multiple languages; many employees receive positive feedback from employers; all developers regularly overcome challenges.
2. **They contain very little detail**. What sort of challenges did the speaker overcome? What type of feedback have they gotten from managers? What sorts of projects have they built?

Let's rewrite the examples above by focusing on **what makes the speaker unique.**

### Good examples

*"I've spent the last several months working on a number of projects: landing pages, APIs, a desktop delivery app for a local restaurant chain. I'm in the top 1% of active GitHub users in my country, which is a small brag but something I'm really proud of.*

*"Before transitioning into software development I worked at a call center for several years. The type of work was definitely different than development, but I also learned several of the skills I now use every day as a developer: problem-solving, effective communication, multi-tasking, and more. I regularly won employee awards, and I now bring the same kind of energy to all of my work, including my growth as a software engineer."*

*"I love coding specifically because I love the puzzle-solving aspect of it. I'm the sort of person who does DSA problems for fun, and I've never met a hackathon I didn't want to sign up for--my last hackathon involved my team working on an app to turn photos into cartoons."*

### Why are these examples good?

Just like we discussed in the previous examples, these examples are strong because:

1. They're **personal and unique.** If you meet a random person at a tech conference, you know that they're not going to have the same elevator pitch that you do.
2. They're **full of detail**. The first example offers details about being in the top 1% of GitHub users, or building an app for a local restaurant. The second mentions details about their success at a prior job. The third discusses experience with a specific hackathon.
3. They **show why you're special**. Each of the examples showcases an achievement, or something the speaker is proud of: specific projects, a high-energy attitude, a life of coding challenges.

Again: focus on what makes you special. People want to know that you're capable of accomplishing cool things, so showcase what you've already accomplished. Even if an accomplishment hasn't been in the world of development (like in the call center example above), you can still explain why those experiences would **benefit** your development.
