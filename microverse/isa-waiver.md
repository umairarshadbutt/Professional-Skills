# ISA waiver

Unfortunately, there are cases when a student may die or become totally and permanently disabled. We will waive the remainder of what you owe under this ISA, including any past due amounts and fees if you die or become totally and permanently disabled.

In cases where you are unable to submit a waiver on your own, a family member may submit on your behalf.

If you would like to assert a waiver based on total and permanent disability, you will need to submit an application accompanied by a physicianâ€™s statement and such other information or documentation that we may require, showing that you are unable to perform any industry-specific work due to a condition that began or deteriorated after the date of your ISA and that the disability is expected to be permanent.

Please refer to the ISA document you signed for more information.
