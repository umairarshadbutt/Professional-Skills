# What is an ISA?

An income share agreement (or ISA) is not a loan or other debt or credit instrument. It is an agreement that is becoming more common in universities and bootcamps for alumni to share a percentage of their future income with the school they attended. Here at Microverse, the agreement represents your obligation to pay 15% of your future earned income, and the income share is not an interest rate or annual percentage rate.

The total amount you will pay under the Agreement will be capped at $15,000.00 (USD) and begins once your income reaches the earned income threshold of $1,000 or more monthly (equivalent to an annual earned income of $12,000 or more).

### What is earned income?

Earned income is your gross income, before taxes. It includes the total of your compensation from employment or any self-employment, whether collected as an employee or an independent contractor, as long as it is generated from industry-specific work.

### What is industry-specific work?

Industry-specific work includes all professional activities performed in Software, Data Science, Cyber Security, and Information Technology.

Example job titles include:

- Web Developer / Front-end Developer / Back-end Developer / Full Stack Developer
- Software Engineer / Programmer / Software Developer / Applications Software Developer
- Web Development Instructor / Web Development Consultant / Software Engineering Consultant
