# ISA payment deferment and extensions

After you finish or withdraw from Microverse, certain circumstances, such as going back to school or earning below the earned income threshold, qualify you for a deferment. If you provide documentation acceptable to us demonstrating a circumstance that qualifies you for a deferment, we will place your account in an inactive/deferment status and you will not be required to make monthly ISA payments.

**Qualifying circumstances are detailed in the ISA contract you signed, and include**:

- Working full-time or part-time, either as an employee or an independent contractor, and earning less than $1,000 monthly (equivalent to an annual earned income of $12,000).
- Unemployed (not working but actively seeking employment).
- Not in the labor force due to illness.
- At least half-time enrollment (as defined by your institution) in a training program that provides an advanced degree (Masterâ€™s Degree or higher), or certification than you are receiving from an accredited academic institution and making satisfactory academic or training progress in the program.

If at any point you receive a deferment, and your circumstances change, you must you must notify us within thirty (30) days.

Please refer to the ISA document you signed for more information.
