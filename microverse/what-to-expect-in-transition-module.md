# What to expect in this transition module

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from the special 1.0 > 2.0 transition module

### Estimated time: .25 hr

## Description

This lesson is just to explain what to expect for the next two weeks, since it's a little bit different than the other Microverse learning modules you've gone through. 

### Why is knowing what to expect important?

Whenever we're doing something new, it can be a little bit confusing. So we wanted to give you a short introduction, so the next two weeks don't come as a surprise! 

### What will this module look like?

The core topics you will cover in this module are: how to interview successfully and what to expect from the job search process. You'll do more professional skills than you've usually been doing, because this is a compressed module, so that you didn't need to repeat Ruby and Rails, which you already learned as part of the 1.0 program. You'll still do some technical activities and small projects that we think will help you moving forward and prepare you for your final capstone, but we also wanted to keep this as short as possible, so you can move forward!

**During the first week** you will do mock interviews with your partner, as well as with people external to Microverse. You will write out and practice answers to behavioral questions, which are often tricky parts of the interview process, so we want to help you nail them. 

**During the second week** you will iterate on your behavioral grid, videos, and cover letter based on feedback, you will learn about APIs in Rails in preparation for your final capstone project, and you will get yourself set up in our job searching tools. You'll refresh your thinking about your dream jobs, so that you'll be ready to talk to your career coach soon about your job searching plan. 

And that's it! Then you will move into the final capstone, and on to search for your next job!
