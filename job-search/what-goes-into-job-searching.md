We have broken down the areas of your job search you do have control over into four categories: Active Job Applications/Interviews, Interview Preparation, Skills Strengthening, and Networking. Let's look at each of those a little more in depth.

**Active Job Applications/Interviews** - This is what you may think of as "job searching" -- sourcing job, applying to them, and interviewing! This is an important part of the search, and one you should do daily or every other day. You should be working to apply to at least 15 jobs each week, and we recommend ~25.

**Interview Preparation** - You may not actually have an interview for a few weeks, and you want to make sure you stay prepared. You also want to take everything you learn after each interview and put it into practice as soon as possible afterward, so you can improve. (Were you asked a technical question you couldn't answer? A behavioral question that you felt unsure responding to? These are both opportunities to practice.) You will use mock interviewing and personal practice to stay sharp for interviews until you accept an offer.

**Skills Strengthening** - While you are looking for a job, you will also want to make the most of this time and use it to learn new things (and keep that GitHub green)! You will be tasked with working on a new side project each month, so that you can practice new skills, build new projects, keep your portfolio up to date, and keep your skills fresh. You can also look for workshops and activities to learn new things. These are often great networking opportunities as well.

**Networking** - Lastly, you must make time to focus on networking. We will talk about this more in depth during your time job searching and circle back to all the curriculum we have on networking in Professional Skills. Networking may look different for each of you, but at the end of the day, it is ensuring that you are becoming a part of the community around the career you want to join: remote web development. By doing this, you will pave the way to a better job right now *and* in the future. We recommend ways to reach out using Twitter or LinkedIn, joining Slack communities, and participating in activities with other developers like Hackathons or open source projects.

**After you have spent three months full time job searching with us, you will have completed (at least) the following:**

- Applied to at least 180 jobs (and reaching out to most of them after one week to check in)
- Created 3 new portfolio projects (either personal side projects or open source work)
- Published and shared 3 technical articles
- Completed 6 mock interviews
- Reached out for 11 networking opportunities
- Continuously honed your application materials and interviewing skills based on feedback during the job search and regular analysis of the process
