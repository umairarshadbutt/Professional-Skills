# How to answer the salary expectation question.

Conducting research on average compensation for both the role and your experience level can lead to productive and informative conversations about pay with your potential employers.

However, this question can still be anxiety inducing and it is important to avoid these common mistakes: 

- **Giving a low number because of lack of work experience**: Many junior developers feel that they need to give a very low number because of the lack of work experience. The assumption is that if they work for cheap, they are more likely to be hired. However, this is an incorrect assumption. When you give a recruiter a very low salary amount, the feeling that you are actually suggesting is: “I am not confident in my skills, and this is a big red flag not to hire me.”
- **Not being realistic about market rates**: Like the point above, if you aren’t realistic about market rate salaries and you respond with an amount that is too high, you’re likely to be filtered out due to budget constraints.

## **How to answer salary expectation questions (with examples)**

When a recruiter or hiring manager asks, “What are your salary expectations?” there are a few ways you can answer. Here are some suggestions, with example responses:

- **Provide a range:** If you don’t feel comfortable providing a single number, you may choose to offer a range instead. However, keep in mind that the employer may opt for the lower end of your range, so make sure your target number is as close to the bottom number as possible. Also, keep your range somewhat tight with a variance of no more than $2000 to $5,000.

Example: *“I am seeking a position that pays between $25,000 and $30,000 annually.”*

- **Include negotiation options:** In addition to your salary, there may be other benefits, perks, or compensation forms you consider just as valuable. Including these as possible opportunities for negotiation is an option, too. For example, while the employer may not have budgeted enough for your ideal salary range, they may be willing to offer equity in the company to make the compensation package more attractive to you.

Example: *“I am seeking a position that pays between $25,000 and $30,000 annually, but I am open to negotiate salary depending on benefits, bonuses, equity, stock options and other opportunities.”*

- **Deflect the question:** If you’re still early in the hiring process and still learning the specifics about the job duties and expectations, you may want to deflect the question later in the conversation. However, keep in mind you’ll still eventually have to discuss salary expectations. Either way, it’s a good idea to be prepared with a well-researched number in mind—even if you’re still factoring in additional information.

Example: *“Before I answer, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what the position entails. That way, I can provide a more realistic expectation.”*

**A reminder on how to determine a good salary range**

Before you give any response, it’s important to do your research to be realistic about your expectations and confidently share a salary range whenever possible. Also, it’s becoming more common to see a salary range listed on some job announcements. If they share that information, be sure that the range you offer aligns with the range listed.

Stack Overflow has a great salary calculator that offers salary info for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Brazil, India, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Sweden. You can also try some more general tools such as Glassdoor and Salary.com, but be sure to use location filters to get a more accurate range. Companies might offer different salary ranges based on location, such as London vs Remote or New York City vs Berlin.

If you seek a remote job and the company is in another country, research the salary for that country instead of your local salary. Also, some remote companies will pay remote salaries with a cost of living modifier attached, so it might be more difficult to assess what that company’s budget might be.

Clockify's Hourly Rate Calculator is meant for freelancers, but it can also help give you an idea because the salary data are grouped into larger regional categories.

Once you have done some research, you can also consider your financial needs to create a salary range that you can share.

**How to create a confident response**

Whether you are speaking directly to a person or responding to an email request, it’s good to work on a script you can reuse. It’s okay to be honest about being new to the industry and potential employers will appreciate that you are straightforward in your communication. Here’s an example response you can refine and practice with your partner or with people in your stand-up team:

- *“Since I am new to the world of web development, I had to do some salary research and I am expecting something in the range of X to Y, depending on if the position is contract or permanent.”*

**Beware of this recruiter trap**

Sometimes a recruiter will ask you for your previous salary as a way to make a low-ball offer. This practice is becoming more uncommon, but if you are faced with this question, do your best to dodge this question so you don’t get locked into accepting a low salary based on your previous salary being low. Here a method to avoid giving them an answer:

- *“My previous experience was unrelated to web development and not aligned with my current skill set. As I move into my new career path, I’m expecting a salary in the range of X to X.”*

**If you are uncomfortable talking about money**

Everyone can improve with practice, but we understand that some people struggle with talking about money. If this describes your personality, here are some tactful ways to dodge the question if you’re in an interview:

- *“I am flexible because I’m focused more on opportunities to learn and grow with solid mentorship.”*
- *“My current priority is finding a role and company that offers a culture that is the right fit for me.”*
- *“Through my research, I have discovered the market rate average is expected to be between X and Y. Would you be willing to share with me if the pay range is for this role matches my research?”*
