### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Learn how to reach out after applying for a job

It's normal in the hiring process for it to take several weeks before you hear back from an employer. One way you might be able to get a response is to send a follow-up email. It doesn't matter if you have been in contact with a recruiter on LinkedIn, or if you applied to a job directly, you can use the same method.

### Why is it important to improve your interview chances by reaching out after your application?

When applying for developer jobs — whether they are local to your region or if they are global remote jobs — you are potentially competing with hundreds of applicants. There is one way to help ensure you get noticed by a hiring manager, and that is to reach out after you apply. Many candidates will not make this extra effort, and you will stand out with your display of eagerness and professionalism.
