# Morning session: Building confidence for job searching - part 1

## Learning objectives

- Be familiar with techniques for building confidence and use them to weather normal ups and downs and support teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.*

In this morning session, you will learn how to apply the growth mindset to your job searching to build and maintain your self-confidence during your job search journey. 

### Why is building confidence for job searching important?

Building your confidence during job searching is essential because rejection is part of any job search and it can make you feel like you're not good enough and demotivate you. 

But being confident will allow you to stay motivated, optimistic, and energized throughout the job searching process....and beyond.

### The importance of the growth mindset in job searching

Throughout the program, you've been building and strengthening your confidence and learning about the benefit of a growth mindset. 

Today we're going to go further and see how you can apply the growth mindset to your job search.  

Why? Because applying a growth mindset will help you succeed in key areas of your job searching journey, such as : 

- Getting confortable with networking
- Being your best in interviews (rather than hoping for the best!)
- Empowering you to apply for a job even if you don't tick all the required boxes
- Managing rejections and learning from them
