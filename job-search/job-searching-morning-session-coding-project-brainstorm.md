# Job Searching morning session: Coding project brainstorm

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

Today you're going to take some time to brainstorm side project ideas with the rest of the group. 

### Why is brainstorming about your project important?

Whether is it to come up with your side project idea or to make the one you have even better, brainstorming is important in order to get the flow going and generate new ideas. 

Great ideas can come from anywhere and anyone and you're most likely to find great ones by discussing, hearing other people's thoughts, and building on each other suggestions.
