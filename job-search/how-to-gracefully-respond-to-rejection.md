# How to gracefully respond to rejection

If you send off dozens of resumes but never hear back at all, congratulations: you've learned that your resume probably requires a revamp. *Free feedback!* 

If the Google Analytics on your portfolio tells you people are visiting your portfolio but still, you never receive interview requests; congratulations: you've learned that your resume is strong, but your portfolio needs improvements! *Free feedback!* 

If you keep getting invited to phone screens but never to a technical interview, congratulations: you've learned that your resume and portfolio are great. Still, it would help if you had practice with responding to phone screen and behavioral questions. *Free feedback!* 

When you consider rejections as impersonal and growth opportunities to help you redirect your job search efforts, they become easier to handle. However, it's still normal to feel a little sad when dealing with rejections.

Regardless, it's important not to let negative emotions affect your actions, so let's look at a list of Dos and Don'ts regarding how to respond to rejections.

**DO NOT**

- Reply angrily to the rejection email or phone call.
- Post angrily about your rejection (or about the company) on social media.
- Beg for another opportunity to prove yourself.

**DO**

- Take a moment to treat yourself kindly! Rejections happen to everyone.
- Think about what you may have learned from the rejection, especially if you already had a phone interview or more. Is there anything you could have improved on during the application process?
- Let the interviewer know that you were grateful for the opportunity and hope to apply again in the future once you're a better fit for the company. This is optional--if you don't want to reply to the rejection, you don't have to! A short message and an invitation to connect can potentially open the door for a future position a year or two down the line.
- Ask for feedback! Again, if you don't want to reply to the rejection, you don't have to. Also, if you were never invited to an interview, most companies won't have enough time to provide individualized feedback. However, if you did complete at least one interview, many companies will often try to provide at least some feedback if you ask for it.
- Connect with the hiring manager/interviewer on LinkedIn! Again, this step is optional, but it leaves the door open for future networking opportunities.

### **Here's an example rejection template that you can customize:**
