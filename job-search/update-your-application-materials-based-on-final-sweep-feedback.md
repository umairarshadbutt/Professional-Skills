# Update your application materials based on "final sweep" feedback

## Learning objectives:

- Review all your job application materials and highlight anything that is out of date.

### **Estimated time**: 2 hrs

## What is the final sweep?

In the last block, you went through and updated your application projects and submitted them to your career coach. Then you received feedback from your coach via a Zendesk message. Now you should take some time to make any changes to them based on feedback your coach shared. 

**NOTE** - If you did not receive feedback from your coach via Zendesk e-mail, please reach out to your coach and let them know, so they can get you feedback as soon as possible. Be sure to search your e-mail inbox first, using the keyword "Final Sweep" as the message may have gotten lost. 

### Why is the final sweep important?

As we mentioned before, you want to do everything you can to improve your chances of landing your dream job. So our coaches work to ensure that your application materials are as good as they can be, so you don't get removed from an interview process for a preventable reason like a type or a poorly worded sentence. 

### Review your feedback and make changes

Now that you've gotten feedback from your coach, make sure to read through it carefully and make changes to your projects. This feedback will be on your Student Dashboard but also in the form of comments on your Google Doc submissions, so be sure to look in both places.
