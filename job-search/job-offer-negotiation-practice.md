# Job offer negotiation practice

There are different ways to negotiate a job offer. You can negotiate for an offer in writing (via email) or during a call or live conversation. 

**Negotiating for an offer in writing.** 

Now that you have done your thorough research (and possibly received another offer!), you are ready to propose a counteroffer. Your general strategy should be to provide a higher number and let them negotiate down. As an example, if your original offer was for $25,000 but your research shows that their average junior developer salary at that company is $30,000, you should be asking for $30,000 + 10% so that they have room to negotiate down.

**Example email template:**

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for offering me the position. I’m super excited and I can hardly wait to get started.

For my base salary, I am looking for something closer to [NUMBER]. The reason is [INSERT TWO OR THREE SENTENCES ABOUT THE VALUE THAT YOU WILL BRING TO THE COMPANY].

Is there any way we can make up the difference?

All the best,

[YOUR NAME]
```

If during your research you have learned you received a very low offer, you can politely let them know you must earn at least market-rate and share your research findings to back up your claim. If they truly cannot work the increase into their budget, they will tell you and you can probably get some other benefit negotiated, such as increased equity or more paid time off. It will then be up to you if you want to accept that offer or walk away knowing you will get offers elsewhere.

**Email template example:**

```
Hi [NAME],

I want to thank you again for the offer and for taking the time to talk to me throughout this interview process at [NAME COMPANY]. I really loved getting to know all of you and am very excited about the offer. The job offer is the perfect fit for my experience and career goals.

I have done some research and I found that the average for this position is [INDUSTRY AVERAGE]. Is there any way we can make up for the difference? I strongly believe I’ll be able to add value to the team due to my [SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF SKILLS YOU WILL OFFER TO THE TEAM].

Thank you again for the offer. I’m sure we can come to an agreement that’s beneficial to us both.

All the best,

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Negotiating for an offer during a call or live conversation.**

The following videos are examples of good and bad job offer negotiation tactics and conversations. 

Context: You have just received an offer as a Junior Ruby on Rails Software Developer at Slack. This is a remote position, while most of your colleagues are based in the USA. You are tasked with negotiating the base salary from 18,000 USD to 22,500 USD. 

[Video to watch: Scenario One](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QapbluL7pTv5blqCQgYbUHWpRrUoaQ0X/view?usp=sharing)

This is an example of a bad negotiation. Although the student said she was happy and thankful for the offer, the student asked for a higher salary in a demanding way, by saying "I cannot work for this type of salary, developers in your country made at least 22,5000 USD or more so I want to have at least the same". Lastly, the student did not give any arguments about why the organization should offer a higher salary.

Scenario Two:

[Video to watch: Scenario Two](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vAxBnzjnwGSjZ0MoB3CMhTgAURVzdy8n/view?usp=sharing)

This is an example of a bad negotiation. The beginning started well as the student tells the organization that they are thankful and excited about the offer. When explaining why they think they deserve a raise, they talk only about factors that are important to the student, not the company. Therefore the hiring manager does not see a reason why they should invest more money in the student.

Scenario Three: 

[Video to watch: Scenario Three](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZN6OgHyDWbGAwZRJjvouQSOwuXD5V1lA/view?usp=sharing)

This is an example of a good negotiation. The student highlights that they are excited about the offer. They request the negotiating, in a kind and non-demanding manner. When asking for a higher base salary, the student highlights what value they will bring to the company, therefore, helping the hiring manager understand why they should invest more in the student and what they will get for that in return. The student reiterates that she is excited about the offer she got. The employer is not able to offer the student exactly what the student asked for, but offered the student an increase from what they initially offered. Therefore both parties are satisfied.

Scenario Four: 

[Video to watch: Scenario Four](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lI_U3PmA12UEqhAGRvcoyuBjbXFOSwbR/view?usp=sharing)

This was a good example of a good negotiation. The student starts by highlighting their excitement for the role. The student highlights that she has gotten a higher offer from another company, but that this company is her first choice. Then, the student states clearly why they deserve the negotiation explaining the other offer as well as the value that the student will bring to the company.

The student highlights again that she believes she deserves 22,500 even after the hiring manager says no. When the hiring manager mentions that a higher base salary is really not possible, the student offers alternative solutions like more equity or a learning stipend. Finally, the student summarizes again that they are excited about the role and wants to find a solution that's best for both parties, and not only for the student.
