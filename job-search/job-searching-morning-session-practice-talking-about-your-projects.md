# Job Searching morning session: Practice talking about your projects

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

In today's morning session you're going to practice talking about your project.

### Why is practicing talking about your projects important?

Being able to talk about your project and accomplishments is important because it is a great opportunity to show your value to potential employers during interviews. 

It is a great way to show them that you're smart, skilled, articulate, and passionate about what you do. And you are! It will show them that you have some practice and experience and that you're able to talk simply and clearly about a project. 

On top of that, it's nice for you to be able to share what you do with others, whether it is a future employer, someone in the industry, or a family member!

> If you canâ€™t get comfortable talking about yourself and your accomplishments, you are not giving yourself the best shot at the opportunities that you deserve.

### Group discussion

**Spend 20 minutes in group discussion.**

- Split into two breakout rooms of 2-3 people.
- Choose who will go first at presenting a project they've been working on or are proud of.
- Have someone play the role of the employer by saying "*Could you please tell me about something you've worked on lately*?". This person will also be the timekeeper.
- Present your project in 3-4 minutes to the rest of the group without being interrupted.
- When finished receive feedback from the other students. Allow 3-4 minutes.

    Examples:

    - "What you did well was ..."
    - "With this project we can tell you are good at ..."
    - "I liked when you said..."
    - "What you could do better is ...."

    Also discuss tone of voice and posture: 

    - Was the flow too fast or too slow?
    - Were you looking confident, passionate, proud?
- Go round until everyone has had a chance to present their project and receive feedback.
