# Practice coming up with a baseline salary to ask for

## Learning objectives

- Evaluate a company and determine a baseline expected salary to ask for if needed.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to help you practice how to draw up salary baselines when asked for salary expectations. 

### Why is practicing coming up with salary baselines is important?

In the early stages of the interview process, you may be asked about your desired salary, and even before you're asked, you would want to carry out your research to give you an idea of what to ask for. 

Knowing what salary baseline to expect helps with the salary negotiation stage of the interview. It helps you know your worth, and improves your understanding of the salary scale in web development. It gives you confidence and helps you prepare so you aren't caught off-guard when the question pops up.
