# Coming up with salary baselines

In the early stages of the interview process, you may be asked about your desired salary — especially if you are dealing with a recruiter. You may also see a section on a job application that requires you to enter your salary to proceed.

**Avoid these common mistakes**

Many junior developers feel that they need to give a very low number because of the lack of work experience. The assumption is that if they work for cheap, they are more likely to be hired. However, this is an incorrect assumption. When you give a recruiter a very low salary amount, the feeling that you are actually suggesting is: *“I am not confident in my skills, and this is a big red flag not to hire me.”*

Similarly, if you aren’t realistic about market rate salaries and you respond with an amount that is too high, you’re likely to be filtered out due to budget constraints.

**How to determine a good salary range using online calculators, job boards, and job descriptions.**

Before you give any response, it’s important to do your research to be realistic about your expectations and confidently share a salary range whenever possible. Also, it’s becoming more common to see a salary range listed on some job announcements. If they share that information, be sure that the range you offer aligns with the range listed.

Good salary research starts by looking up your desired job title by name, geographic location, and years of experience required through free resources like Payscale.com and Salary.com. 

The job title may contain a job level (usually indicated as Senior or Junior). This may also be written in the position level of the role as advertised. Once you know what job level the position is at, you would want to find out the job location and run a search query on Payscale or Salary.com. This search should return the average salary for a web developer (either junior, mid-level or senior) with the desired years of experience. Depending on the location, you can also run a further search using the same platform. 

Stack Overflow has a great salary calculator that offers salary info for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Brazil, India, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Sweden. You can also try some more general tools such as Glassdoor and Salary.com, but be sure to use location filters to get a more accurate range. Companies might offer different salary ranges based on location, such as London vs Remote or New York City vs Berlin.

If you seek a remote job and the company is in another country, research the salary for that country instead of your local salary. Also, some remote companies will pay remote salaries with a cost of living modifier attached, so it might be more difficult to assess what that company’s budget might be.

Clockify's Hourly Rate Calculator is meant for freelancers, but it can also help give you an idea because the salary data are grouped into larger regional categories.

Doing research on the company size and funding is equally important. Well-funded startups that have raised investment capital tend to have higher salary ranges. Large public companies have highly competitive salaries and transparent compensation breakdowns online for different job levels and titles. 

Once you have done some research, you can also consider your financial needs to create a salary range that you can share.

**How to create a confident response**

Whether you are speaking directly to a person or responding to an email request, it’s good to work on a script you can reuse. It’s okay, to be honest about being new to the industry, and potential employers will appreciate that you are straightforward in your communication. Here’s an example response you can refine and practice with your partner or with people in your stand-up team:

- *“Since I am new to the world of web development, I had to do some salary research and I am expecting something in the range of X to Y, depending on if the position is contract or permanent.”*

**Beware of this recruiter trap**

Sometimes a recruiter will ask you for your previous salary as a way to make a low-ball offer. This practice is becoming more uncommon, but if you are faced with this question, do your best to dodge it, so you don’t get locked into accepting a low salary based on your previous salary being low. Here a method to avoid giving them an answer:

- *“My previous experience was unrelated to web development and not aligned with my current skill set. As I move into my new career path, I’m expecting a salary in the range of X to X.”*

**If you are uncomfortable talking about money**

Everyone can improve with practice, but we understand that some people struggle with talking about money. If this describes your personality, here are some tactful ways to dodge the question if you’re in an interview:

- *“I am flexible because I’m focused more on opportunities to learn and grow with solid mentorship.”*
- *“My current priority is finding a role and company that offers a culture that is the right fit for me.”*
- *“Through my research, I have discovered the market rate average is expected to be between X and Y. Would you be willing to share with me if the pay range is for this role matches my research?”*
