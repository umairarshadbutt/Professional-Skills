# The benefits of using Huntr to track your progress

1. **Accountability:** The best way to attain a goal you are after is to hold yourself accountable for the actions you take when working towards that goal. Huntr provides you with a clear view of how many applications you are making on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis so you know whether you are working steadily and consistently towards your goal. 

2. **Direction:** Huntr allows you to get accurate data over time, reflect on the data, and make specific changes that will help you efficiently redirect your efforts. This, in turn, will give your job search more direction which is essential when trying to reach your goal.

3. **Clear status updates:** Imagine you send a follow-up message to a recruiter and the following week, you send another message because you are unsure if you followed up earlier. This can cause frustration on the side of the recruiter so tools like Huntr help you avoid these mistakes by providing you with the following columns: 
    - Wishlist
    - Applied
    - Followed-up
    - Phone Screen
    - Challenge
    - Live Interview
    - Offer Letter
    - Rejected

    All you need to do is simply drag and drop your job application from one column as you go through the various hiring process stages.

4. **The Microverse Job Portal:** This is a portal that the career coaches created in Huntr, where we post jobs every week that we believe are suitable for you to apply to. This will help you reduce the amount of time you spend job hunting on various websites so take advantage of this.

5. **Coach accountability:** Your coach is there to hold you accountable to your goal of finding a remote job. This is why the coach goes through the number of job applications you make each week to ensure you are meeting our recommended standard. We recommend applying for 3-5 jobs daily for the best results in your job search.

6. **Tailored coach support:** When you start job searching, you will have weekly meetings with your coach where they will go over your weekly job applications with you. Huntr will allow the coach to see how many job applications you are making, see if you are getting stuck in a certain part of the hiring process, and will help them provide tailored support for you. 

7. **Tailored support for yourself:** Huntr will also allow you to see where your job search is working and where it is not. For example, are you getting rejected after the behavioral interview? or the technical interview? or at the phone screen interview? When you have the data, you can analyze your progress and take the right action.

8. **Maintaining good Progress scores:** Your Progress score on your Student Dashboard is partly calculated with the number of job applications you make each week. This information is obtained from Huntr so this is also why you need to use Huntr to track your job search. The higher your progress score, the better your chances of being considered for future hiring partner connections.
