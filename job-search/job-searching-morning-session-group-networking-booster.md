# Job Searching morning session: Group networking booster

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

This morning you are going to help and support each other in your job search networking.

### Why is group networking important?

Searching for a job is exciting but also challenging. So group networking is a great way to feel supported and understood in this challenging phase. 

It allows you to share your wins, learn from others and overall feel the support from people going through similar things as you. 

> “We are stronger together than we are alone.” Walter Payton

### Group discussion

**Spend 15 minutes working on the group discussion**

As a group, we invite you to come together and share how your networking is going during your job search. 

Guiding questions: 

- What actions have you taken lately?

Example: Did you like or commented on someone's post? Wrote an article or a post? Send a message to another professional?

- Small wins, big wins, what would you like to celebrate?

Example: "12 people reacted to my post", "I contacted 5 persons", "I wrote 2 posts", "I applied to 8 job offers" etc. 

- What have you learned from your own experience with professionnal social media platforms?
- Share anything else you think would be beneficial to the group.
