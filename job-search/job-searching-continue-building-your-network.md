# Job Searching - Continue building your network

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will refresh your understanding of what networking is and continue building your network during the job search process.  

### Why is continuing building your network important?

Building your network is strengthening your existing relationships and connecting with new people. You can be the best developer in the world but if nobody knows about you or your skills, then your chances of being hired — especially with a remote company — are greatly reduced. The internet has given us endless opportunities to network and connect with other people around the world. Networking allows you to put yourself and your work out there: to showcase your projects, experiences, and connect with like-minded people in the industry. Many opportunities come through connections, so it is a good idea to start building your network today.

### Whom to network with?

Networking will seem like a shot in the dark if you don't have target companies and people to network with. 

The key to efficient networking is to network with people a) you're actually interested in connecting with, and b) who have the potential to make an impact on your job search. The best way to do this is to make a list of dream companies.
