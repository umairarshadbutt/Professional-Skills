### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

In this morning session and in preparation for your job search, you will reflect on your accomplishments throughout the program and identify your unique strengths in order to develop your confidence further. 

### Why is building confidence for job searching important?

Searching for a job is very exciting but is also hard sometimes. It takes time, effort, and a positive mindset. Just like a marathon! 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

But building your confidence will help you stay motivated, consistent, and engaged throughout your job search. 

You can visualize *confidence* as the muscles in your legs. The more you practice, the stronger they get and the easiest the run becomes. So let's get starting!

### The importance of looking back at your accomplishments

In life in general and as students specifically, we are constantly learning, practicing, trying, experimenting, failing, succeeding, and trying again. This is how we grow. 

But we don't always take time to look back and see all the things we've done and accomplished. We're usually busy thinking about the next task or the next homework!

However, taking time to reflect and celebrate your accomplishments is essential. 

Why? Because it will allow you to become fully aware of your unique skills and attributes, identify where you can still make progress, build your self-esteem and overall feel good about yourself!
