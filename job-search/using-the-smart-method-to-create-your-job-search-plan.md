# Using the SMART method to create your job search plan 

A SMART job search plan should have the following elements:

- **Specific**: Think of a job search goal you want to work toward. What would you like to achieve in the next 3-6 months with your job search efforts? Here are some examples:
    - "*I want to get a job as a junior developer in a tech company*".
    - *"I want to be able to answer behavioral questions confidently in interviews."*

- **Measurable**: How will you measure your success? How will you know when you have reached this goal? Here are a few examples:
    - "*I will know that I have achieved success when I get a job offer*".
    - "*I will know I have achieved success when I get at least 5 interviews in the next 3 months*".

- **Actionable**: What actions would you like to take to achieve the goal mentioned above? Each action you choose must have a time frame because this will help give you a target to reach before the deadline, enabling you to really work towards your goal. Here are some examples of actions:
    - **Interviewing actions:** these are actions you can take to help you get better at interviewing. Here are some examples:
        - "I will practice 2 *mock interviews per week with my partner".*
        - "I will do 3 *PRAMP interviews each week".*
        - *"I will practice my elevator pitch every day till I can say it confidently without reading from my paper".*
        
    - **Networking actions:** these are actions you can take to help you get better at networking. Here are some examples:
        - "*I will connect with at least 1 new developer every month".*
        - *"I will reach out to at least 2 recruiters each week".*
        - *"I will publish a new article once every month".*
        - *"I will attend 2 free tech events every week so I can meet others in the industry and grow my connections".*
        
    - **Coding improvement actions:** these are actions you can take to improve your coding skills. Here are some examples:
        - "I will c*ontribute to  1 open-source project for the next 3 months"*
        - " I will do 5 *coding challenges per week".*
        - *"I will try building a new side project in Ruby in one month".*

    **Job application actions:** these are actions you can take to improve the number of job applications you make. Here are some examples:

    - *"I will apply to at least 15 job applications each week".*
    - *"I will dedicate 2 hours of my day to write a personalized cover letter to the dream company I want to work for."*

    You may have other action ideas that are not listed here. There are many possibilities to choose from.

- **Relevant**: What is the reason, purpose, or benefit of accomplishing the goal?

    Here is an example:

    - *"This is relevant to me because I have always wanted a career in web development and I like to build software solutions that solve problems".*

- **Timely**: A good plan must have a time frame set in which you want to achieve your goal.

    Here is an example:

    - *"I will aim to achieve this goal in 3 months".*

    If the goal has not been achieved in that time frame, that is a good time to reflect on the plan, see what is working and what is not, and refine and adapt the plan.
