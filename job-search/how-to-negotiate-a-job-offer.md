# How to negotiate a job offer

If you have never negotiated your salary before, it’s a customary process in this industry, especially for remote roles. It is the process where the potential employee and employer work towards the agreement of salary and sometimes other conditions of employment as well, such as benefits.

After working through the technical coursework and graduating, moving into the job search and landing that first offer is exciting! Companies will often call you with the good news and might even ask you to accept the offer right away. **Do not accept it immediately!**

Take some time to evaluate the offer and determine if it’s a good idea to negotiate. (Hint — it’s almost always a good idea!) You deserve the time to discuss it with a Microverse Career Coach so that you can figure out if you want to negotiate the offer. Thank them with a positive tone, express your enthusiasm for the offer, and politely let them know you will think it over and get back to them within a few days. This will also give you the time to discuss it with your family as well.

Hello [NAME],

That’s such great news! I’m thrilled to hear that.

I greatly appreciate this offer and I’m excited about working with your company. I would like to take some time to read through all the information to make an informed decision. I wonder if I could have until [SPECIFIC DATE IN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS] to get back to you on this opportunity?

Thank you again!

All the best,

Remember, they have just spent a lot of time putting you through the interview process and a company worth working for isn’t going to just walk away over a few days or a few thousand dollars. Be confident during this time, even if you are usually more reserved or shy. You have worked very hard to learn in-demand skills, so you should not feel desperate. The key to this process is to remember that if you don’t ask for more, you can’t get more.

The worst that would likely happen is that they respond with, “We don’t have the budget right now for what you are asking, but we can reassess in 6 months.” Of course, if this happens and you decide to accept the offer, make sure to get this promise to reassess your salary in writing, along with the expected timeline.

Even if you don’t feel like you need more money than was offered, you should go through the following steps to try to negotiate a higher salary.

### **Understand what’s in the offer**

Your actual salary is important, but be sure to review the total compensation. Do you get any health care benefits? Paid time off? If it’s a startup, is there also equity? You should take all of that into consideration because an offer for $30,000 a year without health care benefits of paid time off is not as impressive as an offer of $25,000 a year with employee health care covered and unlimited paid time off.

### **Determine what leverage you may have**

Can you tell how interested they are from their point of view? Were they rushed? Were they clearly interested in you?  Did they complain about how time-consuming it was to find a good quality candidate? Do you have another offer? If so, congratulations! You’re in a very good position to negotiate.

No matter what, be confident in your own status and comfortable walking away, especially if the original offer was unreasonably low.

### **Research what is average for the role you are considering**

Stack Overflow has a great salary calculator that offers salary info for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Brazil, India, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Sweden. You can also try AngelList Startup Salary & Equity or Salary.com, but be sure to use location filters to get a more accurate range.

If you seek a remote job and the company is in another country, research the salary for that country instead of your local salary. Companies usually offer different salary ranges based on location, such as London vs Remote or San Francisco vs Medellín.

### **Find the company salaries online, if available**

You can learn a lot from checking sites like Glassdoor, including salary information. Not every company will be listed there, though, so you might try a simple Google query such as “Andela + salaries.”

Also, refer back to the job posting because many companies will share a salary range on the job posting.

### **Do you have other options?**

You probably have many places listed on your Huntr board where you applied and never heard back from. Now is a good time to email everyone to tell them you have an offer in hand and would like an expedited interview (or final decision). Make sure to tell them you are interested in what they have to offer and give them a deadline.

You’d be surprised at how quickly they sometimes respond when you reply in a more powerful position and with a time limit. The ideal outcome is to get two offers so that you can come from a position of strength when you submit your counteroffer.

```
Hi [NAME],

I am writing to see if I can get an update on the interview process because I've just received a job offer. I’m still really interested in the position at [THIS COMPANY] as I really enjoyed my conversations with everyone I met with so far and am really interested in the challenges and learning opportunities the position would have for me.

Is there any update on this position? You are my first choice of employment so I wanted to reach out to you before accepting my other offer.

Hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,

[YOUR NAME]
