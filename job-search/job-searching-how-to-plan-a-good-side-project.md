# Job Searching - How to plan a good side project

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

After completing the core curriculum at Microverse, we strongly encourage you to start thinking about side projects you can build or contribute to. 

Today we are going to help you pick and plan the right side project for you. 

### Why is having a good side project important?

Working on a side project during your job search will be an asset for several reasons:

1. It helps you practice your skills daily which will keep them sharp, keeps you focused, and keeps your GitHub looking fresh.
2. Building projects can be a lot more fun than repeatedly practicing programming challenges in abstract (e.g. doing LeetCode challenges regularly) and you're more likely to deepen your knowledge by diversifying your experience.
3. The side projects give you an opportunity to meet people and make connections that could possibly lead to a job.
4. Continually expanding your portfolio with more projects will increase the odds that a recruiter or hiring manager will want to interview you when you apply to a position by making your application materials more attractive to them.

### Having your own project and open-source project contribution

Ideally, you should divide your time fairly evenly between building new projects of your own and contributing to open-source projects built by others.

- [Building new projects of your own](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/building-new-projects-of-your-own.md)

### Showing off your work

Anytime you get contributions into someone elseâ€™s project or you finish a side project of your own, you should make sure to update your portfolio, social media profiles, and job application materials to show off your work. 

Always make sure your six most impressive projects are pinned to your GitHub profile and that your most impressive projects are advertised front and center on your portfolio, LinkedIn profile, and AngelList profile too.
