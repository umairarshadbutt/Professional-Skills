Title: Dos and Don'ts of Job Offers

Are you unsure of how to handle a job offer? Here are some dos and don'ts to keep in mind:

Dos:

Take your time to consider the offer and ask for 2-3 days to review the details.
Share the offer with Microverse to get advice from a career coach.
Negotiate your salary confidently.
Don'ts:

Don't accept the offer immediately without taking time to think.
Don't be afraid to negotiate your salary. A company worth working for won't walk away over a few days or a few thousand dollars.
Remember, taking the time to make an informed decision and negotiating your salary can help you attain more successful career outcomes.
