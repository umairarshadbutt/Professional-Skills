# Dos and don'ts of job offers

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about what to do and what not to do when you get a job offer.*

- What actions will help me attain more successful career outcomes?
- What actions could potentially diminish my ability to reach my career goals?

### What not to do when you get a job offer

**Don't accept the offer immediately.**

It’s extremely normal and expected to request a few days to consider an offer, especially for international roles. Let the interviewer know that you’re ecstatic about the good news and excited about the opportunity, then politely ask if you could have 2-3 days to go over the details of the position. Let them know that you plan on giving them your decision by a specific date.

### What to do when you get a job offer

**Share the offer with Microverse.**

Tell us about the job offer by following the link below in the "What do do" section and filling out the job offer form. Then, plan to attend Career Services Office Hours to get advice from a career coach. 

If you need help sooner than the next available office hours, you can reach out to the Career Services on-call career coach by submitting a Zendesk ticket. 

**Negotiate your salary.**

If you have never negotiated your salary before, know that it’s a customary process in this industry, especially for remote roles. It is the process where the potential employee and employer work towards the agreement of salary and sometimes other conditions of employment as well, such as benefits.

Remember, they have just spent a lot of time putting you through the interview process and a company worth working for isn’t going to just walk away over a few days or a few thousand dollars. Be confident during this process because you have worked very hard to learn in-demand skills. The key to this process is to remember that if you don’t ask for more, you can’t get more.
