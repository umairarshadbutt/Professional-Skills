# How and when to send job application follow-ups

It doesn't matter if you have been in contact with a recruiter on LinkedIn, or if you applied to a job directly, you can use the same method.

### **When to follow up:**

- Wait at least 3 days before following up with a recruiter that contacted you on LinkedIn.
- If you applied directly to a job, wait at least one week to respond.

### **How to contact them:**

- **First, you will need to find your decision-maker.** If you didn't already speak to a recruiter and their name is not on the job posting, you can use LinkedIn to do research.
- **Next, install [Clearbit Connect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo)** and open Gmail to complete the installation and get your first direct email address.
- **[Watch this video](https://www.notion.so/6469dbca42364393856f13b0fb5204e8)** to show you how you can use company information from LinkedIn or AngelList with Clearbit Connect to get the email address of the hiring manager or recruiter that you want to message.

Now that you have a good email address, it’s time to craft your message. 

It should be shorter than a cover letter, but it should never say, “What’s the status of my application?” because no hiring manager likes that message.

### **What to say:**

- You should offer a reminder about which role you applied for and what date you applied (which should be on your Huntr board if you’re keeping it up-to-date).
- Share a reference about something that excites you about the job, the company, or the products/services the company offers.
- You should also ask about setting up a call because if you just sign off, “looking forward to hearing from you,” that doesn’t create any sense of urgency in the reader’s response.

### **Here’s an example email you can customize:**

```
Dear (NAME),

I submitted a resume for the (JOB TITLE) position on (THE DATE YOU APPLIED). I would love to learn more about (SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU SAW ON THEIR WEBSITE OR SOCIAL MEDIA). Are you available to chat later this week (OR “next week” IF IT’S ALREADY THE END OF THE WEEK).

I look forward to learning more about working at (COMPANY NAME) and the kind of person you are looking for to fill this role.

Best regards,

(NAME)

If you cannot find the hiring manager after doing your research, you can write to someone else on the team to try to find out who the contact is, but *do not write more than one person*. If you send emails to multiple team members, it can be seen as being pushy or desperate - two qualities you do not want to be known for!

### **Here’s another example email that can be used if you cannot find the hiring manager:**

```
