# Job Searching morning session: Knowledge sharing

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.*

During this morning session, you will think about what has been working for you so far in your job search and share it with the group so that you can all better improve your job searching.

### Why is knowledge sharing important?

Knowledge sharing is fantastic! It's a very efficient way to improve faster and better while feeling supported in the process. 

The best things about receiving knowledge : 

1. It saves you a lot of time and energy! Think about all the things you didn't have to go through to get to the learning part.
2. The other way round, when you learn something the hard way, it will make you feel lighter and better to see that the benefit of this experience goes beyond just yourself. 

The best thing about providing knowledge: 

1. It feels great to share your experience and potentially help someone else.  
2. By saying out loud what you know or learned, it helps you remember it better. 
3. Someone you help will more likely help you in return one day.

### Group discussion

**Spend 20 minutes working on the group discussion**

As a group come together and discuss what has been working for you in your job search and what you've been struggling with. 

The idea is that you learn from each other so that you can all better improve your job search. 

Here are some guiding questions: 

- What has been working well for you in your job search so far?
    - Example: coffee chats with people in the industry, attending online events, writing content on social media, sending applications, talking to recruiters, building your network, etc.
- What have you learned or discovered lately that is helping you in your job search?
- What are you struggling with the most in your job search?
- What piece of advice would you have for other persons in the group struggling on certain topics?
- How can you offer your support?
    - Example: reading through their article draft, practicing interviews with them, etc.
