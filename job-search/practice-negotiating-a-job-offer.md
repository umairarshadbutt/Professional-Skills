### Estimated time: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to guide you through what to do when you get a job offer and practice negotiating an offer. 

### Why is knowing how to negotiate a job offer important?

Job offer negotiations are discussions between yourself and a representative of your current or prospective company that aim to help you secure a higher salary.

It doesn’t matter if you have years of experience or you're just starting out your web development journey: if you feel that your prospective salary isn’t enough, you should feel empowered to negotiate in order to get what you deserve. Negotiating a job offer is a skill that everyone can be benefit from.

It is important to approach job offer negotiations objectively, build an evidence-based case for your desired salary, and then negotiate for this salary.

### How to respond to questions about salary

While you are encouraged to negotiate every job offer you receive, it can be stressful to talk about money. You can manage this stress by preparing and practicing the negotiation ahead of time.

**Guiding questions:**

- Have you ever felt like you wanted more than was presented in a job offer, and did you ask for more?
- How have you negotiated job offers in the past?
