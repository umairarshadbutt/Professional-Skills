# Job Searching - Write a technical article

### **Estimated time**: 3hrs

## Introduction

Today you will use your time to write a technical article. 

### Why is writing a technical article important?

As mentioned in the previous lessons on this topic, writing articles will help you get better at writing documentation, which is an important part of a developer's job. 

But writing technical articles can also help make you attractive to hiring managers because it will show that you can clearly communicate technical ideas to an audience.
