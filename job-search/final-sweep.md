# Final Sweep: prep all your application materials for your coach to review

## Learning objectives:

- Review all your job application materials and highlight anything that is out of date.

### **Estimated time**: 3 hrs

## What is the final sweep?

You're about to head into job searching! That means that it's time to make sure that everything you need to successfully apply to jobs is looking great. This exercise will help you take a look at all the application materials you've created through your time in Microverse, make sure they're looking great, and then submit them to your career coach for review.

### Why is the final sweep important?

Job searching can be a long process. In order to reduce the time it takes for you to land your next role at a company you love, you want to make sure that you've done everything you can to make your application look excellent and stand out from the crowd. This means making sure all the spelling and grammar is perfect, you've highlighted your achievements, showcased your best projects, and are keeping your GitHub green with projects that have compelling READMEs. You've gotten reviews from project reviewers on this work so far, but now your career coach will come through and take a look at everything to help you make sure it's 100% as you start applying to jobs. 

### Review each of your projects

In order to make the best use of your time and your coach's time, make sure you look carefully through each of your projects before you submit the final sweep. Here are links to the initial project walkthroughs, so you can remind yourself what to look for.
