# Job Searching - Send application follow-ups

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Introduction

Today you will take time to send follow-up emails to the job applications you did last week. 

### Why is sending job application follow-ups important?

Sending follow-up emails will increase your chances of getting job interviews.  

It will show recruiters and hiring managers that you're motivated and willing to meet them. This will set you apart from other applicants too. 

### **Refresh your memory about how to send follow-up emails:**

Before sending follow-up emails, remember the following tips:
