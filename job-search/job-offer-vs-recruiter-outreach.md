# Job offer vs. recruiter outreach

In this article, we explain what a recruiter outreach isn't and what it actually is. We also give some guiding definitions and descriptions of a job offer. 

Here are a few things to keep in mind when a recruiter sends a message about a vacancy.

- It is not a job offer. The recruiter may ask for some time to have a conversation with you. This conversation is usually known as the "Information Call," which isn't an interview. Your performance in this call will then determine whether you'd be asked to go through a further application process. Getting positive feedback after the conversation also doesn't mean you have a job offer.
    - The balance careers defined a job offer as "an invitation for a potential employee, whether you have applied for a job or not, to become an employee in your organization. The job offer contains the details of your employment offer." A job offer can either be written in the body of an email or the form of an employment contract (a typed document with the employment terms and details).
    - Any conversation you have with a recruiter that doesn't include the evidence of what has been defined above isn't a job offer.

As a web developer working on professional skills and being visible online, you'll often experience recruiter outreaches if you haven't already. Here are a few ways you can react and respond to them. 

- You're likely not the only one the recruiter is considering or speaking to for the job. You may be on the shortlist, but you must still go through the company's standard application procedure before the team decides whether or not to extend you an offer.
- You have to prepare and tailor your application materials. The recruiter isn't the only one who will go through your portfolio or cover letter. It is important to note that your application will first impression anyone involved in the hiring process.
- You need to take the time to evaluate the job description and see if it sounds interesting to you. Don't be afraid to ask for the job description if the recruiter has not included it in their message to you. Once you've read the full job description, if you don't think you'll like to follow through with the application, don't hesitate to communicate this with the recruiter politely. Be sure to close the conversation on a good note so that you can reach out to the recruiter in the future.

Now that you know the difference between a job offer and an information call, we hope you will be able to use the appropriate terms when expressing any job search updates you may have to avoid confusing your coaches and fellow students. We also hope that you now understand how to react and respond to messages from recruiters.
