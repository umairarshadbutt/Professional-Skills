# Pointers for including links to the GitHub source code and to live demos

- Make sure that **each one of your portfolio projects links to its respective GitHub repository**.
- Make sure to **also include** **live demo links** wherever possible. Not all recruiters have a development background, so not everyone who views your profile will be able to accurately decipher your code. However, if you include live demo links, then everyone—whether they understand software development or not—will be able to look at your projects and gain an understanding of your capabilities.
