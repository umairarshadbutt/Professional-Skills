# Setting up breakout rooms

**Spend no more than 10 minutes on this section.**

**Step 1:** You will be doing this practice interview in pairs. Split yourselves in groups of 2.

**Step 2:** One of you who is the host or co-host will set up the breakout rooms. Check whether you are a host or co-host by clicking the “Participants” icon on the bottom panel.

**Step 3**: A Breakout Rooms window will appear. Choose how many rooms you want to create. As you change the number of rooms, Zoom will tell you approximately how many participants would go in each room if participants were split up evenly.

**Step 4:** Select whether you want Zoom to split up participants into rooms automatically (random) or if you would rather do it manually.

**Step 5:** Once the previous steps are done and everyone is divided into groups of 2 and assigned a breakout room then it’s time to click the Open All Rooms button in the bottom right corner of the Breakout Rooms window.
