### Why is it important to keep the application material looking great during the job search process?

Application material is critical to the job search and must be error-free and capable of marketing the knowledge and skills you have to offer to an employer. Out-dated application material doesn't leave a good impression on the recruiter or job interviewer.

### What application material doesn't go out of date?

There are some parts of the application material which doesn't need to be updated regularly. It includes **screenshots, pictures, videos, photos that are included in a particular project**. Links to the social media accounts also generally remain the same and won't need any regular updates.
