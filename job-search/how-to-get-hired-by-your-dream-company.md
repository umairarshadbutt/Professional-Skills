# How to get hired by your dream company

At some point in their career, everyone has a dream company they'd love to work for. If there are companies that you'd be thrilled to work for, make a habit of keeping them under your radar - and getting on theirs - before you begin applying to these companies.

Here are some tips on tracking your ideal company and getting noticed by them:

- **Do your research and learn as much as you can about the company.**
    - Whether you are looking at your dream company's gorgeous offices online or digging deep for their core values, researching companies in advance is always a great way to learn more about the company. Looking through their online profiles, thinking about the kind of content they share, or checking for Glassdoor reviews are a few ways to find out more about the company.
    - The more you know about a company, the more you'll stand out and impress your interviewer if they ask for your opinion on incidents related to the organization's past. You'll also be able to stand out in your networking conversations and application materials.
- **See how you can craft your narrative.**
    - Why should the company hire you, and how do you fit into the picture? Perhaps you're a full-stack web developer with a passion for educational technology or cryptocurrency. Crafting your career narrative is where your practice with your elevator pitch comes in because you'll need to nail it. Your elevator pitch is the career narrative you'll be pitching to the company's employees you'll be networking with, and you'll need to believe in what you're pitching and sound convincing.
- **Network with current and past employees of your dream company.**
    - Getting your foot in the door is the next step once you've armed yourself with knowledge of the company and a compelling elevator pitch. This means reaching out and making connections with other employees in the organization. If you have an acquaintance who's an employee of the organization, you can politely ask for an introduction to the manager of the position you're looking for. If you do not know anyone in the organization, you can look up some of the employees on LinkedIn, see who you can have easier access to, and connect with them online. Once you have a few of them lined up, you can politely ask them for an informal coffee chat. The purpose of this is to help you get more insider information on the organization and get someone inside to know of your enthusiasm and interest.
    - Any time you come across someone who works for your dream organization, whether in a Slack community or a Meetup group, or at a webinar, consider if there is a way you can connect with them, whether that's working on a problem together, participating in a group with them, or just connecting on LinkedIn. This will enable you to grow your network more in the direction of your dreams.
- **Tailor your application to the role.**
    - Once you are applying to your dream company, and you will want to give it your best shot so there will be no doubt that you will be a good match. Customize your resume and cover letter to be unforgettable and make sure it helps you stand out from the crowd of applicants.
- **Finally, follow up.**
    - It's okay to reach out to the hiring manager or better still - the network you have inside, to let them know of your further interest in an open position and that you have applied. Following up alone doesn't guarantee that you will get a call-back, but your chances will be higher.

The big lesson here is that going after what you want teaches you to put in the work and effort that comes with it. Getting the reward of that is always worth the wait. Good luck!
