### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to define and describe a job offer, as well as the difference between a recruiter outreach and a job offer. 

### Why is it important to understand what a job offer is?

Understanding the difference between starting the hiring process and receiving a job offer can help you better understand what is happening when a recruiter approaches you, and make sure you know when you really have a job offer in hand. 

### What is the difference between a recruiter outreach and a job offer?

You have worked on online profiles, they show your skills in a significant way, and you've started to get some visibility and attract recruiters. It is inspiring to receive a message from a recruiter about an available position. The message you get from a recruiter can be considered a recruiter outreach.

**Guiding questions:**

- Have you received a message from a recruiter or potential employer asking about your qualifications or interest in a vacancy?
- What were your initial thoughts about the outreach mentioned above?
