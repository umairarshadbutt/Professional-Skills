# Things to look out for when looking for a job online

The bullet points below are guidelines to help give you direction in your online search for jobs. They are not strict rules so if you see a job you really want to apply to that doesn't fit into these guidelines, you can apply to it anyway. 

- How many years of experience are required for this job? (for a junior developer role, look for positions with 0 -3 years experience required).
- What are the "must-have/required" skills for this job? Do I have at least one of them?
- What are the "preferred" requirements for this job? Do I have at least one of them?
- Does the job description list at least one of the tech stacks I have worked with?
- Does the job description list at least one of the professional skills I have learnt at Microverse?
- Does the job description say that it is remote to only Europe or America? Or does it simply say remote?
- Does the job description have any contact details (email, LinkedIn profile) for me to reach out to the recruiter later on if needed?
