### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will practice looking for a job to apply to and adding it to your Huntr board.

### Why is adding this job to your Huntr board important?

You might have already looked at a few jobs to apply to in your spare time. You might have applied here and there, gotten rejected, or never heard from the companies again, and thus decided to give up, that this is all a waste of time. However, this is not the case, it is not a waste of time but you need to know how to job search efficiently.

The two tricks to efficient job searching are consistency and retrospection. You need to apply to a consistent amount of jobs every week, and you need to be able to track the status of each job you apply to. Over time, you need to be able to see how many jobs you applied to, at which stage of the hiring process you got dropped off, and how you can improve at that stage in order to get your final offer. This is where Huntr comes in to help you. Huntr is an online platform that helps you stay consistent with your job search and allows you to retrospect carefully on every phase of your job search so that over time, you can see what is working for you and what is not, and be able to make improvements.

### How to look for a job using the Microverse job portal

We created the Microverse job portal, which is a place in Huntr where career coaches add jobs they have sourced online every week. This portal is an extra option that will enable you to apply to more jobs than you would if you were only sourcing jobs on your own. We encourage you to go to the portal, see the jobs that exist there, see if they are a fit for you, and apply.
