# How to track progress while job searching

To track your job search, you will be using two key metrics: the Microverse Progress Score and your Huntr dashboard metrics.

### Huntr

Huntr is the tool you will use to track all of your work toward job applications / interviews, and then be able to see how all of those applications went as your progressed through hiring pipelines. We will talk more in a later lessons about how to use the Huntr metrics to track and analyze your job search. But basically as we've mentioned before, you want to get as much accurate data there about your job search as possible, because that will enable you to look back and make specific changes that will help you efficiently redirect your efforts.

### Networking Tracker

Every week you will have an exercise prompting you to do some networking. Use the Google Doc tracker started in the exercise to track your networking efforts week over week, so you can tell what is working and what isn't. That way you can continue to update your SMART goals and help yourself work smarter, not harder.
