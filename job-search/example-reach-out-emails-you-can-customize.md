# Example reach out emails you can customize

**Here’s an example email that can be used if you are able to identify the hiring manager:**

```
Dear (NAME),

I submitted a resume for the (JOB TITLE) position on (THE DATE YOU APPLIED). I would love to learn more about (SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU SAW ON THEIR WEBSITE OR SOCIAL MEDIA). Are you available to chat later this week (OR “next week” IF IT’S ALREADY THE END OF THE WEEK).

I look forward to learning more about working at (COMPANY NAME) and the kind of person you are looking for to fill this role.

Best regards,

(NAME)
(PORTFOLIO URL)
(PHONE NUMBER)
```

If you cannot find the hiring manager after doing your research, you can write to someone else on the team to try to find out who the contact is, but *do not write more than one person*. If you send emails to multiple team members, it can be seen as being pushy or desperate - two qualities you do not want to be known for!

**Here’s another example email that can be used if you cannot find the hiring manager:**

```
