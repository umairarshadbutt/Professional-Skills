- Describe what you are looking for in your next role and what you need to do to get there.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn to identify what you are looking for in your next role and what clear steps you need to take to get there.

### Why is checking in on your dream job important?

Because checking in on your dream job has a lot of advantages. It will help you determine whether you are still on track with your goal, or help you reflect on whether your dream companies have changed with time. Another huge advantage is that it will help you target your job search much better by identifying which companies to reach out to, who to network with in those companies, which tech events to attend to get noticed, as well as which interviews to prepare for and how to prepare for them. All these preparations will bring you closer and closer to your dream job.

### Check-in on your dream company wishlist

In the lesson *"[Define your dream companies](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-your-dream-companies.md)",* you created a list of the companies you would like to work with,  and also identified similar companies in the industry that you could also work with. This is a great place to restart checking in on your dream companies. Are they still the same? Or have your desires changed? Have you found more companies you would like to add to the list? Give this some thought as you read through your dream company wishlist again.

### Check-in on your dream companies' norms and cultures

In the lesson "[_Learn the norms and culture of your future workplace_](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/learn-the-norms-and-culture-of-your-future-workplace.md)", you created a list of norms and cultures that you wanted to see in your future company. This is a great time to review your dream company list and ask yourself: do these companies have the norms and cultures I want? If they don't you can go back to the list of similar companies you identified in the industry and see if they have the norms and cultures you are interested in. Knowing company norms and cultures that fit you can enable you to ask the right questions in interviews so that you can determine whether the dream company you want to work for fits your style.

### Check-in on steps to getting hired at your dream company

Students often ask *"What advice can you give me to land a job quickly?"*. In the lesson *"[Define your dream companies](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-your-dream-companies.md)",* you learned a very important topic called "_How to get hired by your dream company_".
