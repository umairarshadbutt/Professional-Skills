# What to expect from your daily schedule while you're job searching

While you're job searching, you will continue to meet with your Morning Session group, have a learning partner to check in with during the collaborative session time, and then end your day with your daily stand-up team. 

Morning sessions will be regular interview practice where you and your peers will use breakout rooms and take turns asking each other interview questions or practicing live coding. This is an opportunity to ensure that you are keeping your interviewing skills fresh throughout your job search. You'll also be able to use this opportunity to learn from different peers. Everyone interviews differently, so seeing how other people are responding to questions may give you ideas on how to tweak your own responses to better show up in your interviews. 

During the collaborative session time, you will have a variety of activities to complete. However, unlike during the Core Program, these activities may not take up your entire day. You are intentionally given space for flexibility, so that you can use your own SMART goal plan to guide your job search in the best way that  works for you. You will work with your career coach to set up your personal goals and plan, and then it will be up to you to ensure that you show up every day to work toward that plan. 

Once a week, you will meet with your coaching group where your career coach and up to three of your peers will talk about how your job search is going and get more directed advice about how to proceed. You'll also be able to reach out to your coach any time for advice about particular jobs, job offers, networking opportunities, or anything else coming up for you. They will either help you asynchronously or you can schedule a short 1:1 with them to go over whatever is coming up for you. (Often coaches will meet with students to talk about evaluating job offers and planning negotiation strategies.) 

You'll end your day with your daily stand-up group who will be a group of your peers also working through the job search, so you can all understand where you are in the process and the difficulties of the job search.
