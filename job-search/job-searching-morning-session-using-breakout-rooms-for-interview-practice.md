# Job Searching morning session: Using breakout rooms for interview practice

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

During this morning session, you will get to practice using breakout rooms on Zoom. 

### Why is using breakout rooms for interview practice important?

For the interview practice phase it is important that you get to do as many mock interviews as you can. Breakout rooms are completely separated from the main meeting session. Each participant has full video, audio, and screen share capabilities. They will be used a lot during interview practice sessions and your morning sessions in the next coming weeks.  

### What are breakout rooms?

Breakout rooms are like mini Zoom meetings within your main Zoom meeting. They are a great tool to use when attendees need to participate in small-group activities and discussions.

### How to setup breakout rooms for interview practice

Breakout rooms will help you get into pairs or groups of 2 specifically for behavioral practice, technical question practice, and project presentation practice.
