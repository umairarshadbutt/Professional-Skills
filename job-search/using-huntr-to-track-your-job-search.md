### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to effectively track your job search progress using Huntr.

### Why is tracking your job search important?

Imagine driving a car without a steering wheel. That scenario is bound to be disastrous because you cannot control the direction in which the car goes. This is the same for job searching. If you are just applying to jobs every day without tracking your progress, you could quickly lose motivation and momentum, which could lead to giving up on the whole process. Job trackers like Huntr help you focus on your job search goal, see what actions you are taking to get closer to your goal and help you identify actions to take to improve your job search.

Throughout your job search, you will be using Huntr to track your job search progress.

### What is Huntr and how do I use it while job searching?

Huntr is a job tracking tool that helps you store all your job applications in one place. It allows you to update the status of each application so you don't get lost on which companies you have contacted and which ones you have not. Huntr also gives you statistics on your job search on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis so you can see how consistently you are applying for jobs and if you need to make any changes to your job search pattern. The link below gives you more information on how Huntr works and how you can set it up for your job search.
