# Job Searching - Work on your side project

### Estimated time: 2hrs

## Description

Today you will be working on your side project and moving it forward. 

### Why is working on your side project important?

As mentioned previously working on side projects is important for various reasons:

- It is a great way to keep your GitHub profile green and therefore show hiring managers insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do.
- By practicing you will keep your coding skills sharp. Just like an athlete who works out daily, you need to practice regularly to stay strong.
- New projects also mean new things to talk about in interviews! You'll always have interesting things to share with recruiters and hiring managers.
- And finally, working on your side project is a nice escape from the pure job searching and job application time; it will bring variety to your day.
