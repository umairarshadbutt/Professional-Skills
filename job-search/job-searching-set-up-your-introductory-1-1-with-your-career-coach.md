# Job Searching - Set up your introductory 1:1 with your career coach

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

You should have received a notification to schedule your introductory 1:1 session with your career coach. Today you'll take the time to set up this meeting. 

### Why is meeting up with your career coach important?

Meeting up with your career coach individually is a precious moment! 

It is when you get to talk about your job search and the challenges that come with it. You'll talk about your goals and you'll work together on a plan to achieve them.

### How to prepare for this 1:1 introductory session?

You don't need much preparation, but as a good practice, make sure to:

- Be ready to take notes. This means have a pen and notebook ready for your session, or a clean new file open on your computer.
- Have your Job Searching SMART goals with you. Make sure you have your list close to you so you can share them easily.
- Be prepared to talk about your goals and to work together on a plan to achieve them.
