# Job Searching - Introduction to weekly interviews

### Estimated time: 0.5 hr

## Description

Today we're going to talk about your weekly interviews and show you how you should submit your interview forms each week.

### Why are weekly interviews important?

Weekly interviews are important because "practice makes perfect". In other words, the more you practice, the better you will get and the more comfortable you will be at interviewing.  

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about weekly interviews.*

- Think about a time you practiced something a lot and ended up improving. (eg. video games, sports, instruments)
- Name an athlete, musician, or artist that you like and visualize them practicing their skills. What are they doing? What is their attitude?

> Don’t practice till you get it right, practice till you can’t get it wrong.
