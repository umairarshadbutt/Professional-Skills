Are you looking to showcase your skills as a developer and increase your job opportunities? Adding new projects to your portfolio is a great way to do it! In this exercise, you will learn how to gather screenshots of your projects and include links to your GitHub Source Code and Live Demos.

But why is it important to keep your portfolio updated? Portfolios are the easiest way for recruiters and hiring managers to see what you're capable of and how you've grown in your skills with each project. Plus, each new project often involves more complex skills than the previous ones, so keeping your portfolio up-to-date is essential.

If you're a transition student without a portfolio yet, don't worry! You can simply pin your new project on your GitHub profile and share a link to it. Later on, when you get to the Job Searching part of the Curriculum, you can create your portfolio as a side project.

And if you're a non-transition student with a portfolio already, make sure to read through the DOs and DON'Ts for choosing screenshots and including links to GitHub Source Code and Live Demos. These steps are incredibly important, as they show employers not only that you're a good designer, but also that you're able to write good code.

So, are you ready to take your portfolio to the next level? Check out the exercise in this lesson and get started! #developer #portfolio #coding #jobsearch
