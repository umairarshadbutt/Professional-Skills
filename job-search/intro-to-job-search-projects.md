# Intro to job searching with Microverse

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from job searching with Microverse.

### Estimated time: .25 hr

## Description

Job searching projects are a bit different from the projects you completed earlier in the program. This lesson is to prepare you for the differences, so you can succeed in your job search and get timely support from your career coach. 

### Why is understanding the different projects important?

We want to ensure that you're able to be successful in your job search, so the Microverse program requirements are set up to help you achieve that. Part of this means making sure you're getting feedback from your career coach regularly. In order to do this, you'll need to keep a few things in mind.  

### How will I submit projects while job searching?

Job searching projects are a bit different from the projects you completed earlier in the program. Instead of students reviewing them, or a rotating career coach, you now have your assigned career coach who will be reviewing your work. Since they are one human who doesn't work on the weekends, it's important that you consider when you're submitting projects to ensure you can get review in time. 

This mirrors your working environment when you will need to think ahead about not only your own schedule to complete work but your colleagues schedules in order to complete the whole project. (Code isn't done when it's first written, but when it's been code reviewed and completely shipped out to production!) 

For all projects that require review by your career coach, there will be a notice within the curriculum about when you need to submit the project. Usually it will be by the end of your day Wednesday at the latest. We recommend you submit them as soon as possible. This will give you coach time to review your work and give you feedback before the end of the block. If you haven't been able to submit the project by the expected time, your Student Dashboard will alert you that the project is running late, to help encourage you to submit the project in time to get timely review. 

With all projects, just do your best. Iterative improvements are better than no improvements, and job searching is a marathon, not a sprint. You will want to keep making small changes as you move forward, and your career coach will help you along the way. If you're stuck, submit what you have, and your coach will help you improve it. Don't let perfect be the enemy of done ;)
