# Evaluating jobs/companies based on geographical availability

While reading this, you're probably thinking about jobs and what the job search process could be like. It would be helpful to be prepared for all kinds of job interviews, and whatever is left to learn, you can learn it from doing actual interviews and code contributions. This process won’t be easy. 

Here are different kinds of jobs/companies to consider while building your job application wishlist:

### **Remote + International**

If you don’t live in a developed country and in a major city, chances are that remote and international jobs are the ideal jobs for you. In this type of job, you will join a company that has a distributed/remote team with members in multiple locations around the world, and you will be able to work from home or from a co-working space in your city.

These types of jobs may give you access to higher salaries and better learning opportunities. Some of the companies that offer this type of job are GitLab, Buffer, Doist, Trello, etc. It is helpful to bear in mind that these are also small and medium-sized companies, so the number of open positions may be small.

Your lack of experience should NOT be a reason not to apply to these companies. Remember that companies often ask for requirements and expectations in the job descriptions they can be flexible with. If they like you, they might decide to invest in you anyway.

If you like one of these companies, but they don’t currently have an open position, you should still add them to the list of your “Dream jobs” and keep an eye on them to be among the first ones to know when there is a position available. We will talk about your “Dream jobs” list a little bit later.

### **Remote + Local**

If you come across a company in your country or city that is doing something interesting, you might still want to apply to it even if they don’t pay as well as companies from the first category. The reason is that, at this point, what you need is real-world experience. If a local company is building something that you really like, if it has a strong team, and especially if it gives you the opportunity to work remotely, you should consider applying to work with them.

Finding your dream job and building a successful career is like a marathon. No one finds their dream job in the first job they take. However, a local job where you can learn and work remotely will give you the chance to continue growing while getting more experience working remotely.

This will, later on, open more doors to jobs from the first category (remote + international) since you will have more experience, both from a technical point of view and also as a remote worker.

### **Relocation-based jobs**

Not everyone is willing to move to a different city or a different country for a job, but if you are, then your list of potential jobs just grew immensely. Most jobs won’t be close to you, and many companies don’t have remote teams, but if you are willing to move, you can start applying to almost any software job available in the world. This can be a great first step toward moving into a remote position once you've gained some experience.

Keep in mind that there will be immigration barriers and relocation costs. However, many companies will be willing to take care of all of that if they find the right candidate. Knowing which companies will take care of that is not trivial, but you will start seeing companies who offer that as part of the job description.

If you are willing to relocate, then you should not just look for local and remote jobs, but you should also make a list of the countries you are interested in and start looking on their local job boards.

### **Local jobs**

Finally, there are local jobs with no remote teams. Unless you live in a developed country and in a major city, your chances and your salary will be limited in this case, but a local and low-pay job is better than no job if you have never worked as a software developer before. Remember that you can always move to a new job when a better opportunity comes up. We will recommend that you start with the other types of jobs, but you should keep your eyes open for local opportunities too, especially if you don't already have software development experience.
