# Define your dream companies

## Learning objectives

- Define your dream companies.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to help you draft a list of dream companies you can refine along your Microverse program until job search. 

### Why is drafting a list of dream companies important?

At some point in their career, everyone has a dream company they'd love to work for. If there are companies that you'd be thrilled to work for, make a habit of keeping them under your radar - and getting on theirs - before you begin applying to these companies. Keeping and refining a list can help you with a job search strategy and networking efforts. 

### Drafting a list of dream companies

While going through a program like the Microverse Program and launching a tech career, you'll likely think about your current needs and what you'll like in a new job, as well as what sort of organization to work for. It’s great to create a list. It helps organize your thoughts and narrow down what you want.

**Guiding questions:**

- What do/don’t you want in a job?
- What companies do you want to work for?
