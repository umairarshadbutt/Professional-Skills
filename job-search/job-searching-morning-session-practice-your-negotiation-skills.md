# Job Searching morning session: Practice your negotiation skills

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually.*

During this morning session, you will get to practice job offer negotiation skills which you will want to keep fresh throughout your time job searching.

### Why is practicing negotiation skills important?

Knowing how to negotiate salary offers is a valuable skill that can help ensure you’re fairly compensated for the work you do. However, like any skill, it takes preparation and practice to do well. If you don’t feel the pay aligns with your education, career level, skill set and experience, you may choose to negotiate for more money. You may also suggest another form of compensation, such as equity or stock options, or additional perks such as extra vacation days.

### Job offer negotiation practice

While you are encouraged to negotiate every job offer you receive, it can be stressful to talk about money. You can manage this stress by preparing and practicing the negotiation ahead of time.
