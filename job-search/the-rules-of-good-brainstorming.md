# The rules of good brainstorming

To ensure you get the best value out of your brainstorming, follow the basic rules below:

1. Never judge someone else's idea! There is NO wrong answer in a brainstorming. 
2. Build on the ideas of others. Example: start your sentences with "Yes and..."
3. Encourage wild ideas. Have fun, don't restrict yourself.
4. Go for quantity.
5. Stay focused on the topic. 
6. One conversation at the time. Stay active but don't talk over each other. 
7. Be visual. You might want to express your idea visually rather than verbally. 
8. HAVE FUN! Brainstormings are a great moment to get creative.
