# When and how to follow up on a job application

### **When to follow up:**

- Wait at least 3 days before following up with a recruiter that contacted you on LinkedIn.
- If you applied directly to a job, wait at least one week to respond.

### **How to contact them:**

- **First, you will need to find your decision-maker.** If you didn't already speak to a recruiter and their name is not on the job posting, you can use LinkedIn to do research.
- **Next, install [Clearbit Connect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo)** and open Gmail to complete the installation and get your first direct email address.
- **[Watch this video](https://www.loom.com/share/6469dbca42364393856f13b0fb5204e8)** to show you how you can use company information from LinkedIn or AngelList with Clearbit Connect to get the email address of the hiring manager or recruiter that you want to message.

Now that you have a good email address, it’s time to craft your message. It should be shorter than a cover letter, but it should never say, “What’s the status of my application?” because no hiring manager likes that message.

### **What to say:**

- You should offer a reminder about which role you applied for and what date you applied (which should be on your Huntr board if you’re keeping it up-to-date).
- Share some reference about something that excites you about the job, the company, or the products/services the company offers.
- You should also ask about setting up a call because if you just sign off, “looking forward to hearing from you,” that doesn’t create any sense of urgency in the reader’s response.
