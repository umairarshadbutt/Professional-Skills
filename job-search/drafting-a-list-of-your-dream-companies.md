# Drafting a list of your dream companies

There are creative ways to build your target list so you can find your own job leads and not be dependent on third-party recruiters and job boards. The first step to drafting a list of your dream companies is to write down the name of any organization you've always wanted to work for. You may notice that you exhaust the mental list you've made quickly; no worries about this because the following steps will help you research and find more amazing companies to add to your list.  

1. **List the types of companies you'll like to work with, based on geographical location.**

    Think about the types of companies that will be a good fit for your current situation (remote, relocation, or local job?) 

2. **Research the different companies that exist under the categories you have chosen above.** 

    Run a search of companies that fall under your preferred categories above in a search engine of your choice. A good search example of running will be "Remote companies in Mexico" or "International remote companies hiring right now." Explore any search results that seem relevant and useful. 

3. **Create a list of companies mentioned in the search results that interest you.** 

    Think about what it is about these companies that inspire you to work for them. When writing down these traits, use them to come up with other companies that seem to embody those same traits and philosophies. 

4. **Group the companies based on the industries they belong to.** 

    Grouping the companies gives you the opportunity to research more companies within the same industry and your geographical location of choice. 

5. **Expand your search.** 

    Now expand your search by thinking about competitors, affiliates, and clients of the companies on your list. You can generate this list by running further search queries until you have enough companies on your wishlist (ideally 10 - 15 ðŸ˜ƒ).
