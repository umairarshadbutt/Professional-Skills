# Application material that needs regular update

Some of the top things that go out of date are: 

- **Live project links.** Not all recruiters have a development background, so not everyone who views your profile will be able to accurately decipher your code. Click on links for live projects to make sure those are still working.
- **Contact form.** Contact form provides a way for prospective employers to reach out to you. Sometimes the contact form doesn't send notification emails on new submissions. Double-check that your contact form is working.
- **Add new work to your portfolio.** Make sure any new work or projects you have done are getting added to your portfolio, pinned GitHub, updated on your LinkedIn, etc. You can pin new gists and repositories to your profile so other people can quickly see your best work.
- **Portfolio Analytics.** Check your portfolio analytics regularly to see what kind of traffic you're getting and make sure analytics are working. This part is about regular monitoring which in turn can help us learn reasons for why things are not working.

    Google Analytics will tell you **exactly which of your application materials are strongest and which are weakest**, which can then tell you exactly how to improve your chances of getting a job. Google Analytics will tell you exactly where potential hiring managers might be losing interest. Let’s explain what we mean by that.

    Logically, the more jobs you apply to, the more people should visit your portfolio. If your portfolio **does not** see an increase in visitors, then you can assume that’s because your resume and application aren’t currently strong enough to get a hiring manager’s attention. In that case, start working on improving your resume. 

    Let’s say that Google Analytics shows that people do start visiting your portfolio, but you never receive requests for interviews. In that case, you can assume that your resume and application are strong, but that your portfolio isn’t showcasing your strength. In that case, you can begin working on expanding portfolio projects or revamping the UI.
