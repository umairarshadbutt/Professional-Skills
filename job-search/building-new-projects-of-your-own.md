# Building new projects of your own

In addition to contributing to open source projects, it's very useful to build side projects that are all your own, or that you build with a team of equal partners. This gives you an opportunity to gain experience with defining a product and designing the user experience, defining project architecture, scoping the work, and performing routine maintenance, all of which are skills that will be useful to you as a developer at many companies.

### **Defining a product and designing the user experience**

When conceptualizing your new project, the first and most important question to ask is will this project be genuinely useful to somebody? If so, even if the target audience is small, then it's probably worth building. Consider that user and their use cases when deciding what this project will do. For example, if you are building a productivity app that will automate a previously tedious process, then how can you implement that automation? What would be the most attractive and intuitive user interface for it?

### **Defining project architecture**

When deciding what tech stack to use on your new project, there are both objective and subjective factors to consider. To the extent possible, you want to use the best tool for the job where there are clear ways to determine that.

For instance, if you're building a performance-sensitive web application, you may want to consider using a progressive enhancement approach with vanilla JavaScript instead of React, or consider using the project as an opportunity to learn new technologies like WebAssembly to write your frontend code in a lower-level programming language to take advantage of its faster performance. Be careful about premature optimization though. You don't want to spend so much time optimizing your code or your architecture that you slow down your productivity to the point when you can never finish the project. You can always refactor it later after you get an initial version out.

Also bear in mind that some architecture choices are purely subjective. For instance, when trying to decide between using something like Ruby on Rails or the Django Python framework on the backend, there are fewer objective points of comparison. The two languages and frameworks perform similarly, so which to use is more a question of taste. Which do you like better? Which do you feel more comfortable programming in? Go with that.

### **Scoping the work**

Time is limited. You should prioritize one or two core features to implement on your side project, then maintain a backlog of other features or bugs to work on later sorted by their relative importance that you can get to later, time permitting. Once your one or two core features are implemented and working, launch your project. Don't wait until it's perfect. Get it to MVP (minimum viable product) and get it out there for people to use.

Yes, there will be bugs, unoptimized code, or other things in it you might find embarrassing. It's okay, really! Every program ever written by anybody still has bugs to fix or features that could still be implemented. Don't worry about what you didn't get to. Take pride in what you accomplished. Even if only one person benefits from what you made, then youâ€™ve made a positive impact on the world and you should be proud of that.

### **Performing routine maintenance**

Software projects are only "finished" in the way that lawns are "mowed." It takes continuous maintenance to keep a project healthy. You need to keep your dependencies updated, fix bugs that come up, implement those missing features you didn't get to when you launched, etc. While it's important to launch as soon as you have your MVP, it's also important to continuously improve your projects over time, bit by bit. Employers who see you making small, steady contributions to your projects will be more likely to want to interview you because you're publicly demonstrating commitment to a larger vision. It shows them you understand that building great products is more like tending a garden than carving a sculpture.
