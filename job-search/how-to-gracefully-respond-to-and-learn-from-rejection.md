# How to gracefully respond to and learn from rejection

## Learning objectives

- Practice how to respond gracefully to rejection and turn them into learning opportunities.

### Estimated time: 0.75h

## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to share the importance and guides to gracefully responding to and learning from a rejection message or email.  

### Why is gracefully responding to and learning from rejection important?

Finding out that you didn’t get a job can be difficult. When you get a job rejection email, it’s tempting to simply delete it from your inbox and move on. However, sending a thoughtful response to this rejection is a better choice for your career in the long run.

It can also be liberating: if you **already know** that nearly every job application will result in a rejection, you no longer need to feel nervous or anxious. Instead, you can look at each job application--and each interview--as a learning experience. In other words, don't think about applications as job opportunities. Instead, **think about them as a chance to get feedback from professional software developers for free.**

### How to gracefully respond to rejection.

Rejection can help you learn about yourself through feedback and you can implement the lessons for success in future interviews.
Guiding questions:

- Have you received feedback from a rejection that helped you improve your skill?
- How has rejection helped you refocus your job search efforts?
