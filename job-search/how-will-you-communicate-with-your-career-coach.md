# How will you communicate with your career coach?

You will meet with your career coach in a weekly coaching group meeting with up to three other Micronauts. You will be expected to attend this meeting every week, unless you have to schedule an interview during that time. 

During the coaching group meetings, you'll check in with your coach and peers on how your job search is going and get  chance to ask questions about anything coming up for you (difficulties you're experiencing, questions about part of the job search, etc.) 

Outside of the meeting, you'll be able to reach your coach via Zendesk about anything from getting feedback on improving your application materials to negotiating a job offer. If it's something time sensitive, especially around job offers, you'll be encouraged to schedule a short 1:1 call with your coach, so they can help you talk through whatever you need. You should always reach out to your coach *immediately* if you get a job offer, so they can help you negotiate it and make the best choice for you. 

As with all communication, your coach will best be able to help you if you provide as much information as possible in your initial messages. We encourage you to give as much context as you can about any issues you're having or potential offers you're considering. You can always use a Loom video to talk out an issue instead of typing it all out,  if that is more comfortable for you. Doing this will be excellent practice for your future remote workplace.
