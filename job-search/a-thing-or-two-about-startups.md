# A thing or two about startups

As we mentioned in a previous section, startups can be a great opportunity to find your first job. They often solve exciting problems and are eager to find talented people, which sometimes makes them more open to hiring remotely if they find the right candidate.

### AngelList

One of the best sources of jobs offered by startups is AngelList. You already have an account there, so you should be able to start applying for jobs immediately. Go to "Jobs," which can be found in the menu, and use tags to filter the types of jobs you are interested in. You should select “Software Engineer” in the “Role” drop-down, select “Remote” and any location that you are interested in in the “Location” drop-down (e.g., if you are willing to relocate to any country in Europe, you can select Europe as location). You can leave the other filters unused for now. Later on, you can start adding tags such as “React” or “Ruby” or “Ruby on Rails” if you get results that are too broad. Remember to always filter by Role and Location at least.

To apply for a job on AngelList, you have to click on “Apply Now.” If the company also clicks on you, you will get introduced to each other.

### Hacker News

Hacker News is a forum and community created by Y Combinator, the accelerator where Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe got started, among many others. Hacker News is an amazing source of news and interesting resources for developers, hackers, and founders. Among those resources, a list of companies looking for software developers and freelancers is posted every month.  Every month, you will see two new posts created by that account: companies looking for employees and another for companies looking for freelancers. You should take a look at both of them. Just scan through the list and notice if there is any company that gets your attention. They will include information about the role and how to apply to it. Just keep in mind that many of those jobs are only available to people in the US, but not exclusively.
