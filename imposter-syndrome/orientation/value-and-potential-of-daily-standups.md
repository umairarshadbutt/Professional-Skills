## Description

This lesson will help you become familiar with the value and importance of daily standups at Microverse, which take place at the end of every program day, as you have experienced this week.

### Why are daily stand-ups important?

Daily standups and weekly retrospectives are common practices in software developer teams and technology companies. They serve a lot of purposes; they help with productivity, bring clarity to your goals, help you communicate with your team, and help you overcome your blockers. We use them as a company at Microverse too. We want you to work with them daily at Microverse, to help you become more productive but also so you are ready for when you use them in your software development job after Microverse!
