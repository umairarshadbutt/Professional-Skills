# Professionalism guidelines in Slack

Below are 5 guidelines that you should always follow while communicating on Slack. These guidelines are in line with the student Code of Conduct and failure to follow them can result in disciplinary action or expulsion from Microverse

## Be respectful of other students.

- Be kind, friendly, and helpful. Talk to your Microverse peer as you would to a new friend. Never say something written that you would not say to someone in real life

## Assume positive intent.

- If you read something that sounds offensive, do not respond angrily as written communication can often cause misunderstandings. Instead, reach out to that student and ask to clarify in private through Loom or a Zoom call.

## Praise publicly, but criticize in private through a direct message.

- If you have constructive feedback for a team member, write them through a direct message. It can be hurtful to receive constructive feedback in front of a lot of other students.

## Use professional communication at all times.

- Do not use foul language, make sexist remarks, or post inappropriate content.
- Do not use cuss words, do not post memes about religion, do not post racist jokes, do not post sexist jokes.

## Be patient if a student does not reply immediately outside of program hours.

- Make agreements beforehand about communication outside Program hours. Do not spam students with excessive messages.
