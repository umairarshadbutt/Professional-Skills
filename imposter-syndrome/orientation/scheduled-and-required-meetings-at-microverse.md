## Required Meetings

- Morning Session Group meetings
  - During the morning session, each student must spend at least 20 minutes on the call;
- Program Time sessions:
  - You are highly encouraged, but not required, to spend all day in a call with your partner(s);
  - Whether studying alone, working with a partner, or working in a group project, you are **required** to check in with your teammates twice a day, during morning Program Time and afternoon Program Time. You are required to join these meetings **on time** (between 8:30 am and 12:00 pm scheduled program time for Program Time 1, and between 12:00 pm and 4:45 pm for Program Time 2. During those sessions, **you need to meet for at least 10 minutes with your teammate(s)**. If you do not check in, we will count you as absent.
  - You must take a break between two calls. If you spend the whole day on just one call, you will likely be marked absent for the second Program Time session, as Zoom will attribute time spent on the call to only the first session.
  - Any time you write a line of code for a collaborative project, you **must** be on a call with your partner doing pair programming.
- Daily Standup meetings
  - During daily stand-up, each student must spend at least 10 minutes on the call.
