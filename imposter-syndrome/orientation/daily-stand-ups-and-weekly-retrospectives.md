# Daily standups and weekly retrospectives

Daily standups and weekly retrospectives allow you to set goals for the future and reflect on goals from the past. They allow you to reflect on blockers and turn that into strategies to overcome those blockers in the future. Daily standups and weekly retrospectives are also great tools that allow you to give status updates to your team and share tips on how to improve your workflow.

### Setting goals

Setting goals and reflecting on them is a skill that will help you get ahead, not only in your Microverse journey but also later in your career. Through setting goals you will get to bring your desired future by bringing clarity and focus. This clarity and focus will help you balance out the stress of completing the curriculum. Goals will motivate you to keep working hard, will teach you to learn from your mistakes, and help you achieve your desired professional and personal outcomes.

We reflect on whether we made our goals because if we didn't it means we need to change something in our behavior next week.

### **Blockers or challenges**

Experiencing blockers or challenges is expected. We cannot expect to operate at 100% productivity and reach all of our goals on a weekly basis.

Many different things may keep you from reaching your goal. It's important to be honest with yourself. Identifying the right issue will help you adjust your goals to improve your performance the following week. Are you not reaching your goals due to your behavior from yourself like lack of motivation or lack of time-management? Or are you having difficulties with your partners due to conflict or having different working styles? Sometimes we don't reach our goals due to external factors like financial difficulties or internet problems.

By self-assessing and identifying the blockers, you can actively do something to overcome your blocker. Either by reaching out to your stand-up team, student success, or trying out a specific strategy related to your blocker.

### Celebrating what went well

Did you achieve a goal faster than expected? Great! Write it down. Did you get positive feedback from someone? Also, write it down! It's important to keep track of things that go well to celebrate small wins and to give ourselves an overview of what our strengths are so we can do more of that in the future. Celebrating what went well is also known to raise motivation! Make sure you have a document like a Google Doc or notes where you can look back on at the end of the week to help you fill out this information.
