# Actions to enlist family support

The following will help you garner more support from your family, and help them understand what you are doing at Microverse.

### Explain to and show your family what coding is if needed

Many of our students (and staff as well!) come from families unfamiliar with coding. Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents may not understand what it is you're trying to do, and why it's valuable. Take the time to have conversations with them about it. Show them websites, and talk about coding as being the ability to build those. If they have a smartphone, talk about building applications as being part of coding.

### Define and share your goals with your family

**Define several big goals you want to achieve in the next 12 months. Write them down**. Writing down our goals makes us much more likely to accomplish them. Learn how to set great goals by looking at the "Additional resources" section of this lesson on the main activity page.

Gather your family and friends and share your aspirations with them. Explain what your goals are, and why it is important for you to achieve them.

I**n upcoming months regularly talk with your family about your progress.** By being transparent about how your studies are going, you are asking them to hold you accountable for your progress and for achieving your goals.

### Talk about your blockers and ask for help

**Commit yourself to regularly share your concerns, challenges and blockers with your family and friends.** Keeping them in the loop about any potential issues and blockers will enable them to help you when those challenges appear. Even if they will not be able to help you directly, having their understanding and practical support will be beneficial in getting back on track.

### Limit distractions during study hours

Working or studying from home brings a set of distractions which are not common in regular classrooms.  Although it might seem impossible to avoid distractions, it is important to establish a clear set of rules to minimize disruption during study hours. For example, if you are regularly distracted by social network notifications on your cell phone, leave it in another room during your Microverse day.

Family and friends can prove to be distractions as well. Asking you to do certain chores, starting small talk or asking non-urgent questions can be difficult to avoid. You need to make sure they understand which disruptions are acceptable and which can wait until you complete your study day.
