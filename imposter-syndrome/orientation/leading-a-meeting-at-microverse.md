# Leading a meeting at Microverse

You will have different types of meetings at Microverse with different activities. Whether you are working with your morning session group on professional skill activities with your morning session team, working on coding challenges, or doing the Daily Standup meeting with your standup team, a leader will ensure that the activity goes well.

### Tasks as a leader

When it's your turn to lead, follow these guidelines to help your team stay focused and meet your goals.

- Give everyone a minute or so to enter the meeting and say hi to everyone, then start the meeting by reminding your team what the purpose is of the meeting and what activity is taking place.
- Make sure everyone has their camera on.
- Keep track of time; this means making sure you have time for different parts of the activities and ensuring everyone can take their turn. Be aware when the conversation goes off-topic and bring it back by reminding your team of the goal for this meeting so you can finish promptly.
- Lead the discussion; if an exercise had discussion questions, introduce them to the group and make sure everyone participates in the questions by directing the questions to different team members. You can also ask follow-up questions like asking if anyone else has felt similar or if anyone has an opposing view.
- Wrap up and finish the meeting on time.

### Leading a discussion

Leading a discussion can feel like a scary task at first. But below are two tips that can help you set up for success.

1. **Appoint people to respond if participation is low.** Ask your team members direct questions if no one wants to go first, especially if you don't have a lot of time. Time can be wasted by waiting for someone to speak up so it helps to appoint names. This is also a great tool for when a team member hasn't said anything.
2. **Ask follow-up questions to make the discussion flow.** Some examples are: Has anyone else felt like team member X? Has anyone felt anything different from team member X?
