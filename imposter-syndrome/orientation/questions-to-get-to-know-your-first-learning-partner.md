# **Questions to get to know your first learning partner(s)**

Each student at Microverse is unique, and we pride ourselves on bringing together students from a diversity of cultures and backgrounds. Each time you meet a new partner, you have the chance to get to know someone different from yourself. Putting time into getting to know each other as people with interests, families, communities and more will really help you understand each other as you learn and work together in the program.

Take turns asking each other these questions, or choose 1 at a time and both answer it. How exactly you proceed is up to you—the important thing is that you make an effort to really get to know one another! Also note—these questions are suggestions; you can make up your own too, as long as you're always professional, and follow the Code of Conduct.

- Background
  - What were you doing before Microverse?
  - What is your family like?
  - Tell me about where you live. Is it a big city? Small town? Do you like it? Why/why not?
  - What languages do you speak?
- Interests and Hobbies
  - What do you like to do in your free time?
  - What were your favorite things to play as a child?
  - When you and your friends get together, what do you usually do? (pre-Covid? During Covid?)
- Culture and Diversity
  - What are the main holidays in your family/culture/community?
  - What is your favorite holiday? Why is this your favorite?
  - What languages are spoken in your town/country/community?

Talk about as many questions as you have time for in about 10 minutes, and then return to the main activity page to continue.
