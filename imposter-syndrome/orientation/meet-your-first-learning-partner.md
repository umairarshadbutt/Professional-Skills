# Meet your first Learning Partner

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

The goal of this activity is to get to know your learning partner(s) and set working agreements with them. Connect with your partner(s) in a Zoom call through your student dashboard before starting this activity.

### How to connect with your first learning partner(s)

You should have already received a message introducing you to your partner(s). Earlier today, you connected your Zoom account to Microverse, so you should now see a link to your partner(s) in your Student Dashboard. Send your partner(s) a message on Slack if they aren't in the Zoom call when you join. If you can't find your partner, contact Student Success before moving forward.

### Why should you spend time getting to know your learning partner(s)?

You're in a remote program that is a community. Your first learning partner(s) may later become your pair programming partners or be in your standup team. Each time you work with a new person at Microverse, you have a chance to build your network. More importantly, teamwork happens with people and getting to know one another as human beings is the foundation of working together successfully.

### Get to know each other

Relationships begin with curiosity about other people. They start with sharing a little about yourself and showing interest in your partner(s).

Use the following questions to spend 10 minutes talking with your new partners and getting to know each other.

### Learn about working agreements

In your first week, you'll be meeting twice daily with your learning partner(s). You won't be collaborating on projects, but you will be joining calls to check in with each other. Setting working agreements with teammates you'll be interacting with every day will help you stay coordinated and work more smoothly together this week.
