## Description

This lesson talks about why a meeting needs a leader, how to lead meetings well, and the benefits of practicing this skill.

### Why is leading group meetings important?

Meetings often serve the specific purpose of discussing a topic or getting a task done within a limited amount of time. As more people participate in the meeting it can be more difficult to manage time. To make a meeting more efficient and productive while allowing everyone to participate, meetings often have leaders. The role of the leader is to start and finish the meeting, make sure that other students are participating in the discussion, and keep track of time.

Leading a meeting is a skill that gets easier as you have more experience with it. It will allow you to make sure that each meeting is done successfully and that all team members were able to participate. Showing leadership skills in the meetings will not only impress your future managers but will also allow you to engage other teammembers and come to better solutions and outcomes in the meeting itself. Practicing these skills will train your English skills, your time-management skills, and your critical thinking skills.
