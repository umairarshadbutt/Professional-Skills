# Teammate checkins during program time sessions

During your Program Time at Microverse (the main part of your daily schedule), you will have three main types of collaboration:

- **Learning Partner(s):** Week 1 (this week) and many more throughout the program.  When you have a Learning Partner, you will support each other and help each other with questions, but you are not collaborating together on technical projects. You must join a call with your Learning Partner(s) 2x a day as described in the attendance policy.
- **Pair Programming Partner:** During weeks where you do collaborative projects, you have a partner and pair program together. You must join a call with your partner 2x a day as described in the attendance policy.
- **Group Project Group:** Starting later in the Program, you will be in a group of 2-4 students for group projects. During these weeks you must join a call with your Group Project Group 2x as a day as described in the attendance policy.
