# Slack vs. Zendesk vs. Discourse

We have different platforms for different kinds of questions. But how do know which one to use? Below you can find an overview of what each platform is used for with some example questions.

### Slack: non-technical questions for other students

Slack is an informal community tool. You can use it for any informal, non-technical-related questions that you have for other students.

- What are the best internet providers in Uganda?
- How do other students at Microverse deal with low motivation?
- I am sharing my React capstone. I had a lot of fun building this project and got the feeling that I like to work with react. It is a responsive application that displays information about tv shows from tvmaze API. If you like it my project, can you give it a star on GitHub?
- I wrote my first article talking about one of the worst enemies of a software developer and my experience dealing with it. Can you read it and give me any feedback on it?

### Zendesk: non-technical questions for Microverse staff

Zendesk is a formal tool used to communicate with Microverse staff. You can use it to look up FAQ articles any time you have a question that is non-technical related to the Program. You can also use Zendesk for feature requests and curriculum requests.

- Why was I counted as absent during my Morning Session meeting?
- What are the deadlines during HTML?
- How do I request Capstone projects?
- I don't have access to the dashboard. What do I do?

### Discourse: technical questions for students and code-reviewers

Discourse is a platform used for technical questions. Other students and code-reviewers will unblock you and provide technical help.
