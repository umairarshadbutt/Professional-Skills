## Description

This lesson helps you understand the different ways in which you can get help at Microverse. 

### Why is getting help important?

As you're learning about all the different tools, parts, and policies at Microverse, you might have some questions that come up. When that happens, you should know where to look. We have different places and tools for different kinds of information. Knowing when and where to reach out for help is also a top skill in the remote work environment. 

### Introduction to Zendesk

Zendesk is the main tool you will use to communicate with the Microverse staff about non-technical questions. Find out through the links below how to use Zendesk. 

Before going through the materials below, think about the following questions:

- Where can I find answers to my questions?
- What do I do if my question is not answered by an FAQ?
- How can I reach out to Student Success?

**Learn more about Zendesk and how to gain access:** 

- [What is Zendesk and how can I gain access?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/orientation/zendesk.md)

Please read the following FAQ if you were unable to access Zendesk. If after looking at the FAQ, you are still unable to access Zendesk **please email success@microverse.org to get help. Make sure you explain what you did and what happened so that they can resolve the issue quick*ly.*

Before watching the video, think about the following questions

- What is a technical question?
- What type of questions are answered in Discourse?
