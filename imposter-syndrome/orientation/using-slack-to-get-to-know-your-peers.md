# Using Slack to get to know your peers

Slack is the platform we use to help our students communicate with each other.  As your community tool, Slack is the place you will speak to your stand-up team, mentor, coding partner, and your Microverse friends, all in one place. Although you may have used Slack before, make sure you follow the steps below to set up your profile and meet your support network. Microverse staff will only use Slack to share announcements that you might not have seen in Zendesk.

### Set up your Slack Profile

Although Slack is our community tool it's important to remember that it is still a workplace tool and you will be using it to speak to your colleagues. Remember, this is your professional network so keep a positive and mature presence at all times. Please go ahead and make sure that:

1. Your account has a picture where your face is clearly recognisable
2. You are using your first and last name

### Say "Hi" to your mentor!

You should have received a Slack message introducing you to your mentor in Slack. Go ahead and say "Hi" to them. Why not let them know any questions you have at the moment or tell them how your first day is going so far?

### Say "Hi" to your morning session team!

You should have been invited to a private Slack channel that you and the other members of your morning session team will use to help each other every day. Go ahead and say "Hi" to them. 

### Say "Hi" to your stand-up team!

You should have been invited to a private Slack channel that you and the other members of your stand-up team will use to help each other every day. Go ahead and say "Hi" to them. Perhaps let them know an interesting fact about yourself?

### Say "Hi" to everyone!

You should have been invited to a private Slack channel called #full-time-students where all the students of Microverse hang out and help each other. Go ahead and introduce yourself in that channel, and don't forget to say where you are from!

### Join our other Channels

Take a look around in Slack and get to know our different channels. We use channels to keep conversations organized by topic so rather than posting about your achievements in the full-time student's channel you can post about them in the #achievements channel! Add yourself to the channels below now:

- **#announcements-** This is where the Microverse staff make announcements to the school.
- **#achievements-** A Slack channel where you should post about your own achievements and celebrate the achievements of others
- **#lunch-and-learn-** This is where you will receive updates about lunch and learns that are taking place in the Program where a student talks about their journey to a software development job.
