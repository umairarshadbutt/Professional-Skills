# First week at Microverse

### What is Orientation day?

It’s your first day at Microverse, your Orientation Day. Today you will learn all the things that you will need to succeed at the Microverse: tools, support network, daily activities, and program expectations. Let’s start learning together!

After today:

- You will understand the main tools you will need in the program and meet your first coding partner.
- You will understand the Microverse Program as a whole and the principles under which it was designed.
- You will understand the daily activities and rituals you will be doing in the program.
- You will understand the Code of Conduct and policies (attendance, deadlines, and plagiarism) that we will apply during the program to create a supportive and safe learning environment for everyone.
- You will meet your standup team, a group of students that will meet with each day along your Microverse journey. This group will change weekly during the first module at Microverse.

### What will you learn during your first week at Microverse?

By the end of this week:

- You will refresh basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- You will learn about linters, git, and GitHub.
- You will learn about code reviews.
- You will understand the deadlines in the Program.
- You will submit your first technical project and professional skill project.

### What does collaboration look like during your first week at Microverse?

Starting on Monday, you will have a **learning partner**. As learning partners, you will work on projects individually but you meet every day during the morning and afternoon collaboration session to give each other support, accountability and discuss any questions you might have. You may choose to work together for the entire collaboration session, but the minimum requirement is 10 minutes during the morning collaboration session and 10 minutes in the afternoon collaboration session. In weeks where you have learning partners, the technical project of the week will be done **individually.**

This is different from weeks where you have **coding partners,** where you collaborate on technical projects together through pair programming. You will have coding partners later in the Program.

If you do not hear back from your learning partner or your parner isn't following the collaboration requirements, please reach out to Student Success right away so we can help figure out what is going on. 

For onboarding, you will work together with your partner once you've linked your Zoom Account to your dashboard. (more on that later!)
