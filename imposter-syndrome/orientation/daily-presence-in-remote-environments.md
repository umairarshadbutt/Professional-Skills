## Description

This lesson talks about the importance of attendance and daily presence in remote environments, beginning with expectations here at Microverse.

### Why is attendance important?

Being present every day is important because it helps you gain momentum in your learning. Working and learning daily allows you to consistently build knowledge. Following a rigorous schedule will allow you to build some of the most important skills to be a successful professional: reliability, accountability, and punctuality.
