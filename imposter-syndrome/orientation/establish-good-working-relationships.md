# Establish good working relationships

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

With every person you collaborate with, you'll want to invest a little time getting to know each other and setting working agreements. Think of yourself as developing new habits for collaboration that you'll be repeating again and again throughout the program. Join your coding partner(s) in a Zoom call and do this lesson together.

### Why spend time getting to know your coding partner(s)?

Microverse is a community of people focused on the same goal of learning to code and getting a job. Each time you meet a new partner, you have the chance to get to know someone different from yourself. Putting time into getting to know each other as people with interests, families, communities, and more will help you understand each other as you learn and work together.  It may feel strange at first to get to know people you haven't met in person, but you will get used to it.

### Get to know each other

Use the following questions to spend 10 minutes talking with your new partner(s) and getting to know each other.

- [Questions to get to know your pair programming partner(s)](questions-to-get-to-know-your-pair-programming-partners.md)

### Set your working agreements

In an earlier lesson, you learned about setting working agreements with new partners. You learned about working agreements as a way to talk about how you'll work together *ahead of time* and make agreements that helps teamwork go more smoothly. With pair programming partners, you'll be collaborating intensively, and working agreements are **even more essential**.

Spend 10 minutes reading the following article with your partner(s) and discussing the questions.
