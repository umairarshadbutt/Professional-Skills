# Talking with your Family about Microverse

### Learning objectives

- Explain why you have chosen to attend Microverse and be part of our Micronaut community.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

This exercise will help you prepare for a discussion with your family and friends about the level of commitment required by Microverse and about what support they can provide you during this period.

## The importance of family support during your time at Microverse

The next few months will require you to successfully balance your study obligations with your personal life, family and friends. In order to achieve good results, and have a stable level of commitment required by the program, you'll need to have the support and understanding of those closest to you.

As a student at Microverse you might not have to think about long commute times, getting to the classroom on time, or memorizing tons of lessons for a quiz, but there is a different set of challenges ahead of you. As a remote student, you now need to worry about other concerns such as the stability of your internet connection or power supply, your motivation, or distractions in your study space.

Some of you will surely face those blockers during your time here, but having a stable support system by your family and friends can help you overcome potential challenges, concerns and frustrations.

## Enlist the support of your family

In order to get your family and friends onboard, as well as to ensure their support over the next few months, we have a set of recommended actions you can take.

Remote work and study are still relatively new concepts for most, and your family might not understand the specifics of what your days are going to look like. There are a few common questions most remote workers get from their close ones, and the following article provides tips on how to answer these common questions.
