# Working agreements for successful pair programming

Collaboration can be hard at times. Teams don't always get along, and people want to do things differently. Misunderstandings can happen. Working agreements help set you up for success with each coding partner you have so you can pair program together and resolve any issues that arise.

Spend 10 minutes reading through the following areas of common working agreements and discuss with your partner as you go.

- What time you will meet each day
  - The minimum requirement is to meet your partner for at least 10 minutes once between 8:30 am and 12:00 noon in your program timezone and again between 1:00 pm and 4:45 pm. On project building days, you'll spend much more than 10 minutes, as you'll need to be in a Zoom call while pair programming in projects.
  - What time will you meet each day for check-ins when you are studying?
- How you will work together
  - While pair programming, I prefer to switch roles _______ (how often?)
  - If you're the driver while pair programming and I don't understand, what should I do?
  - If you're the navigator while pair programming and you don't say anything, what should I do so that you understand better what I am doing?
  - If we're moving too quickly for me, how should I tell you?
  - If we're moving too slowly for me, how should I tell you?
  - How are we going to make decisions when we disagree on how to proceed? (e.g. take turns deciding who will make the decision; talk about it and come to agreement)
  - Will you make changes to the project outside of pair programming, or will you check with each other first?
- How you will communicate
  - If one of you will be late, how will you tell each other? (Slack? WhatsApp? Other?)
  - If one of you will be absent, how will we let each other know?
  - If one of you gets frustrated by something, how will you talk about it?
  - If one of you can't understand the other's English or need them to slow down, how do you tell them?
- Study agreements
  - Do you prefer to study alone or jointly with your coding partner?
  - If you both like studying together, do you want to make a set time every day when you study together?
- Workspace and equipment
  - If one of you has a lot of background noise, or problems with your equipment, what will you do?
