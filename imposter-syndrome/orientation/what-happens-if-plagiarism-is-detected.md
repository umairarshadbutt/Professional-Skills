# **What happens if plagiarism is detected?**

When our system flags your work as plagiarism, we will have another look at your code to confirm whether it has been copied or not, and whether it is breaking our plagiarism guidelines.

### **When will we contact you for suspected plagiarism?**

We will not randomly flag you for plagiarism. We will always need significant proof to start a plagiarism case, and if your code is not copied you should be fine. Your code will not be flagged in cases of accidental code similarity.

If you copy a limited amount of code from a resource that is not a direct solution to the complete assignment, you should also be fine as long as you understand your code.

**Exceptions:**

1. When your assignment tells you to copy code or fork something, plagiarism guidelines and rules will not apply.
2. Using libraries is not considered plagiarism.

### What happens if your assignment is flagged for plagiarism?

If it is clearly breaking the rules, we will send you a message that you are suspected of plagiarism.

You will get a "**Sorry Period" of 5 working days** to hand in a new assignment with your own original code. If you hand in your new finished assignment before the deadline of 5 working days, you can continue your course at Microverse. **If you plagiarize for the second time, you will be asked to leave Microverse.**

If you receive a plagiarism notice message from us, and you know your work isn’t plagiarized, do send us a message clearly explaining your case. We will look into your explanation for why the code is so similar. If your explanation is valid, we will apologize for the inconvenience and you can continue the program. **If your explanation is not valid or true, you have the risk of being asked to leave the program and will not get a Sorry Period.**

### What happens if you are flagged for plagiarism for the second time?

If you plagiarize for the second time, and do not have a valid explanation for the similarity of your code, **you will be removed from the program without the chance to redo the assignment.**
