# Questions to get to know your pair programming partners

Each student at Microverse is unique, and we pride ourselves on bringing together students from a diversity of cultures and backgrounds. Use each new pairing you have as a chance to get to know a new person, build your network, and set yourself up to work well as a team.

Take turns asking each other these questions, or choose 1 at a time, and both answer it. How exactly you proceed is up to youâ€”the important thing is that you make an effort to get to know one another! Also, note these questions are suggestions; you can make up your own too, as long as you're always professional and follow the Code of Conduct.

- Background
  - How did you first become interested in coding?
  - What were you doing before Microverse?
  - What is your family like? Do you have brothers or sisters?
  - Tell me about where you live. Is it a big city? Small town? Do you like it? Why/why not?
  - Have you ever lived anywhere else? Where?
  - What languages do you speak?
- Interests and Hobbies
  - What do you like to do in your free time?
  - What were your favorite things to do as a child?
  - When you and your friends get together, what do you usually do? (pre-Covid? During Covid?)
- Culture and Diversity
  - What are the main holidays in your family/culture/community?
  - What is your favorite holiday? Why is this your favorite?
  - What languages are spoken in your town/country/community?

Talk about as many questions as you have time for in about 10 minutes, and then return to the main activity page to continue.
