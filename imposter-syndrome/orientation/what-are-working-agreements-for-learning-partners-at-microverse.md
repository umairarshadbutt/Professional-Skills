# **What are working agreements for learning partners at Microverse?**

Working agreements are agreements on *how* you will work together. Learning partners check in with each other twice a day and support each other while learning. Agreeing on things ahead of time with your new partner(s) will help your week go more smoothly.

Working agreements for learning partners typically fall into the following categories. Read through them together and discuss with your partner(s) for 10 minutes.

- What time you will meet each day
  - The requirement is to meet for at least 10 minutes once between 8:30 am and 12:00 noon in your program timezone, and again between 1:00 pm and 4:45 pm.
  - You'll need to agree with your partner(s) what time you will do your daily check-in meetings
- How you will communicate
  - If one of you will be late, how will you tell each other? (Slack? WhatsApp? Other?)
  - If one of you will be absent, how will we let each other know?
  - If one of you gets frustrated by something, how will you talk about it?
- Study agreements
  - Do you prefer to study alone or jointly with your learning partner(s)?
  - If you both like studying together, do you want to make a set time every day when you study together?
- Workspace and equipment
  - If one of you has a lot of background noise, or problems with your equipment, what will you do?

Talking about these areas ahead of time will help you and your learning partner(s) set expectations for how you will work together this week. Return to the main activity page now to complete your exercise with the agreements you've discussed.
