# About You: Financial health survey

## Learning Goals:

- See Microverse as a professional environment and understand the necessity to develop the skills needed to be an international professional.
- Understand that Microverse's program has a core, direct goal of getting you to employment.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

In this step, we want to know more about you and your financial health.

### Why is financial health important?

Your financial health is important for us to know so we can understand your financial stability as finances impact your long-term commitment to the program. With the financial survey, we can better understand the specifics of your situation and help us understand the different kinds of support our students need. This will in no way affect your status in the program!
