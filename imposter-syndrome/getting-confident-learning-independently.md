# Getting confident learning independently

## Learning objectives:

- Demonstrate the ability to learn in a self-directed way.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll learn about different ways people learn and techniques you can use to support your own independent learning. 

### Why is this important?

When we learn in classrooms, teachers not only provide subject matter information but they also adapt learning experiences to support the ways that different students learn. When learning independently, we need to identify our own learning styles and find ways to support our own learning.

### Learning styles

**Guiding questions:**

- What are the different ways that information can be presented or understood?
- What is your own learning style (i.e. how do you learn best)?
- What are some methods that can help support your own learning style?

**Learn more about learning styles:**

There are 4 keys ways that people prefer to learn: visually (seeing); auditorily (hearing), reading/writing, and kinesthetically (doing). Some people use a combination of these styles. Review the article and video below to learn more about different learning styles.

**Identifying your own learning style**

Now that you know that there are different learning styles, you can start to identify your own preferred style. Part of a growth mindset is recognizing that you may need to find a different way of interacting with certain information for you to fully understand and apply it. This can help you determine the types of tools and methods you may need to use when learning independently.
