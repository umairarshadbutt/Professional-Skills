# Morning Session: Cultivating a Growth Mindset Part 2

## Learning objectives

- Identify the impacts of imposter syndrome and whether you experience any of this.
- Understand that ebbs and flows in confidence are normal for any professional.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this morning session, you will learn about reflection which is an important part of the growth mindset. "Reflection" is the process of recognizing your growth and cultivating positive thinking to help avoid imposter syndrome.

### Why is reflection important in a growth mindset?

Have you ever had an exam where you answered all questions correctly except for 1 or 2 and you obsessed over those 1 or 2 wrong answers? Yes, the human brain has a tendency to celebrate success for a very short amount of time and to hold on to failures and negativity for a longer amount of time, making us overthink our negative experiences.

Focusing intensively on the negative aspects of our experiences can reduce our ability to develop a growth mindset. Reflection on what we have accomplished is extremely important as it shows us that every day, we are getting better and better no matter how big or small the accomplishment is. This helps fuel our motivation and encourages us to push forward and continue growing.

### What is reflection in a growth mindset?

Reflection is the ability to look at everything you have accomplished no matter how big or small and see the growth you have made in that space of time. It is a constant practice that should be developed not only in your journey at Microverse, but also beyond in your future job, and also in your personal life. Reflection on how far you have come is a key element to help reduce imposter syndrome which you learned about in the lesson "*Introduction to imposter syndrome*".
