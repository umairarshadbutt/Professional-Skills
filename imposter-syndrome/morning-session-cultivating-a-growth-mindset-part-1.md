# Morning Session: Cultivating a Growth Mindset Part 1

## Learning objectives

- Identify the impacts of imposter syndrome and whether you experience any of this.
- Understand that ebbs and flows in confidence are normal for any professional.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this morning session, you will learn about the idea of growth mindset and how to use it to build your confidence.

### Why is cultivating a growth mindset important?

Your entire life is a learning process. No matter how good you become at coding, you will always have to learn something new. No matter how good you are in your job, there will always be a challenge you have to deal with so you can learn from it. These challenges can take many forms like an extremely tough problem you are given to solve, or disputes with colleagues, and more.

The ability to see a challenge and grow from it is the basis of the growth mindset. This is why it is important to start cultivating a growth mindset as soon as possible.

### The difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset

There are two types of mindsets: A fixed mindset and a growth mindset.

A growth mindset is a way of thinking that suggests learning is a continuous process rather than a fixed process. Put differently, intelligence is something you develop, not something you're born with. The growth mindset favors learning over talent and believes that we can accomplish what we desire through continuous work, learning from feedback, and persistence.

A fixed mindset, on the other hand, suggests that if you do not know something now, you will never know it or you are not talented enough to know it. The fixed mindset is a closed way of thinking that increases your imposter syndrome which in turn, demotivates you. This demotivation can cause a lack of productivity and reduce your chances of meeting your dream goal.
