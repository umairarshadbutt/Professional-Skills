# Ways to seek information on your own

Follow the steps below to find information on your own:

1. Break the problem down into little pieces and then decide what is really holding you back. This technique is called Rubber duck debugging, which you can learn more about in the *Additional Materials section* on the main page of this lesson. Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem.
2. You should also do a Google search to find relevant information for your problem. This is an important skill that is crucial for every developer to learn. You can learn more about how to use Google to solve your programming questions *in the Additional Materials section* on the main page of this lesson.
3. Instructional Youtube videos and blogs by techies also act as great ways of seeking information on the problem that you are facing. 
4. Check Stack Overflow for possible solutions. 

In case none of the above steps help you in figuring out the solution, then move to the next section.
