# Morning session: Easing stress with memes, part 2 

## Learning objectives

- Appropriately use humor as a tool for bonding with teammates and managing stress.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In today's meme-making exercise you will be learning a bit more about memes, sharing the ones created during the last session, and voting on the best ones. 

### How to use different memes

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

In the last session on memes, we discussed what memes are and how they can help people relate to a shared experience. Take a few minutes to scroll to the *[How to use them](https://www.wix.com/blog/2017/07/what-are-memes/#:~:text=fun-,How%20to%20use%20them,resources%20you%20should%20try,-Memedad)* section in this article on memes. You can learn about what a variety of popular memes were meant to describe and see examples of how they were used. Think about these intentions as you share your own memes about the capstone project with your teammates. 

## Exercise

### Instructions

*Spend the next 20 minutes working on this together as a team.*

1. Today you will be sharing the other memes you created in the last session. Teammates will vote on which of the 3 memes **created by each teammate** they think is the best. Each teammate will then be encouraged to share their top-voted meme with the rest of the cohort.
2. Open the exercise template to help you take notes, if needed.
3. Share all memes with the group, one person at a time, for example:
    - Team member 1 shares links to all 3 memes they created with the rest of the team. Laugh, discuss and comment.
    - Then, the rest of the team votes for the best meme created by this person.
4. Complete step 3 until all team members have shared their memes and each person has a winning meme.
5. (Optional) After submitting your exercise, make your fellow students laugh. Share your winning memes with the rest of the cohort, or with the wider school audience in Slack.
