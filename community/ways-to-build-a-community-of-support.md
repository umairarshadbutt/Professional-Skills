# Ways to build a community of support

First, you have to begin. **Reach out to people who share similar interests or who share your
enthusiasm for your organization's purpose**. The more intentional effort you put into building solid relationships, the greater the likelihood you will have the support you need when you need it.    Second, be resilient. Don’t stop if the first few attempts to get someone’s attention or to get on their calendar to meet fails.

Relationship building takes a lot of psychological testing of the waters of trust. In the end, the bottom line result is increased positive feelings from the support you receive, a sense of well-being from knowing you are not alone in your efforts to achieve, and friends to celebrate your next success. However, any relationship needs mutual support to prosper and flourish. 

Look at the ways below in which you can help the relationship grow. 

**Be helpful first**

For example, if you are present when a colleague is given feedback that a presentation or project is not good enough, offer assistance. It is important to be thoughtful how your offer. In this case, do not say “can I help you?” Instead, share “I once worked on a project like this. May I lend my experience to your next round of thinking?” You will be learning who you can trust when you need help and you will learn the different experiences your co-workers offer.

**Express sincere appreciation and acknowledge the help you received**

Remember to express sincere appreciation for what you have learned, how the person has helped, and the bond you have forged.

Acknowledge the support you have received from them and share your gratitude for receiving it. 

This lays a strong foundation for strong bonds in our personal and professional lives.
