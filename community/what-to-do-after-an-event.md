# What to do after an event
**Stay connected:** Donâ€™t forget about the people you met at the event now that it is over. Connect with them on LinkedIn, add them to Twitter. Send them a short message telling them how nice it was to meet them at the event. Staying in contact will make it easier for them to remember you and provide you with a support structure for the future if you ever need advice or guidance during your job search. 

**Tweet about the event:** Say something on social media about the event you just attended. Remember to use the hashtag of the event in your tweet so that it reaches all the attendees. Every event has a particular hashtag created by the organizers so remember to ask them for it or go to the website of the event and look for the hashtag. In your tweet, you can also tag a presenter you liked at the event as well because they tend to have a large network and this could help you grow your network.

**Write about the event:** Write an article on your favorite blogging website (for example, Medium is a good website) about one of the presentations you liked during the event or the event in general. Share your article with friends, family, and on your social media too, using hashtags to tag in the presenters or the organizers of the event. The more you share your articles with the world, the more visible you and your skills are to the world.
