### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to get better at seeking help by knowing when to seek help, how to seek information on your own, and ways of getting unstuck.

### Why is getting better at seeking help important?

Asking for help doesn't come naturally to many people. Only a few people enjoy asking for help. As research in neuroscience and psychology shows, the social threats involved—*the uncertainty, risk of rejection, the potential for diminished status, and giving away of control*—activate the same brain regions that physical pain does. *And in the workplace, where we’re typically keen to demonstrate as much expertise, competence, and confidence as possible, it can feel particularly uncomfortable to make such requests.*

However, it’s virtually impossible to advance in modern organizations without assistance from others. Not asking for help also results in unnecessary stress and impacts your decision-making and productivity, increases mistakes, and damages the overall outcome of whatever project you’re working on. Your performance, development, and career progression depend more than ever on your seeking out the advice, referrals, and resources you need.  In fact, estimates suggest that as much as 75% to 90% of the help coworkers give one another is in response to direct appeals.

### What is a reasonable amount of time to try before seeking help?

**Guiding questions:**

- What do you think is the right time to seek help?
- Have you had any experiences where you felt that you sought help much before it was needed?

Identifying when to ask for help is a key skill to master not only at Microverse but later in your workplace as well. In a busy workplace, you can't ask for help all the time. And it may not look good if you have to do so over and over again.

### How to seek information on your own

**Guiding questions:**

- What are the ways in which you seek information about the possible solutions?

In the last section, you would have identified the problem and are seeking to find information related to the problem on your own.

### Ways of getting unstuck

**Guiding questions:**

- What do you generally do to get unstuck after you have tried solving it on your own?

The last 2 sections would have helped you in moving towards getting unstuck. In case you are still stuck, a few ways are there to get you unstuck.

### Building a long term community of support

**Guiding questions:**

- Do you have people whom you can fall back on for personal or professional help?

The ways shared in the sections above are helpful in getting our short-term problems resolved.       

However, to ensure better support in our learning and growth it is vital to have strong relationships. Relationship building is a proven part of the science of flourishing and well-being in all aspects of life and work.
