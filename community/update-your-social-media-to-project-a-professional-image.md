# Update your social media to project a professional image

## Learning objectives

- Show a professional online presence on social media.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will update your social media presence to ensure you project a professional image.

### Why is updating your social media presence important?

In the lesson *[What does your social media presence say about you?](what-does-your-social-media-presence-say-about-you-and-what-might-you-want-to-change.md)* we learned the following topics:

- The importance of having a professional social media presence
- The importance of protecting your privacy on social media

Social media, if not maintained correctly, can project a negative image of you to recruiters and in turn, negatively impact your interview and job opportunities. We want to avoid this as much as possible, so we will help you update your social media to ensure anything public projects a professional image.
