# Ways to get unstuck

Follow the steps below to get unstuck:

1. Now it's time to ask relevant people to get help. You can reach out to your coding partner(s), your morning session group, your stand-up team, your Microverse mentor, or the senior code reviewers. When you reach out, show them what you have already done. Not only will they see that as helpful to what they have to accomplish, but they will also know you are not simply asking them to just do it for you.
2. Ask your friends across the school or in other places if they have worked on a similar problem. 
3. Post your question on discussion forums of coding platforms such as Microverse's Discourse, Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.  

Always be sure to express gratitude for the help/support you have received.
