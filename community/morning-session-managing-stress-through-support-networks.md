# Morning Session managing stress through support networks

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of building a support network within a remote learning setting and have tools to do so.

### Estimated time: 0.5 h

## Description

In this lesson, we will talk about the importance of having a support network to help relieve stress in your time as a remote student. You will learn skills you can apply here and in future remote jobs.

### Why is managing stress through support networks important?

Having a social support network has been proven to help relieve stress. The remote environment at Microverse and later in the workplace can make it more difficult to create a social network. That's why you must be proactive about creating a good support network and having people that you can rely on.

Being able to share a difficulty or ask someone for help can help us overcome the challenge or make us more resilient to dealing with this stress. On the other hand, isolation can cause harm to our mental and physical health.
