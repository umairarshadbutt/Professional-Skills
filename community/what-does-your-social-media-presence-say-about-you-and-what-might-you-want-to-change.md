## Learning objectives

- Show a professional online presence on social media.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn what your social media presence says about you, why it is important, and the things you can change to improve your profile.

### Why is your social media presence important?

The world is now more connected than ever through the internet. A simple search for someone on the internet can give you a glimpse of their professional and personal lives through Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and more platforms. Hiring managers can search these profiles and create a first impression of you in their minds.

A public social media presence that shows images of parties and fun might not resonate well with recruiters who may consider you as not being serious. On the other hand, a public social media presence that shows professionalism, interest in the tech industry, teamwork, and communication could be very interesting to recruiters and increase their confidence in hiring you. It is thus important to take care of your social media image and presence.
