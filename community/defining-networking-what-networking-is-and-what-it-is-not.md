# Defining networking: What networking is and what it is not

### What networking is not

- Networking is **not** spamming your potential connections with numerous referral requests, interview requests, or requests to review your projects and portfolios.
- Networking is **not** about being fake in your interactions: For example, lying or pretending to be interested in what someone does just so you can ask them later, "Do you have a job for me?" People can sense a fake attitude from miles away so you want to steer clear of that.
- Networking is **not** being desperate: Reaching out to people you don't know is not a sign of desperation. On the contrary, it is a sign of determination; a sign that you are willing to keep pushing doors towards your goal.

### What is networking?

Networking is about building relationships. True, genuine relationships. Think of it as being similar to making friends in real life. The key to efficient networking is to network with people a) you're **actually** interested in connecting with, and b) who have the potential to make an impact on your job search and your tech career.
