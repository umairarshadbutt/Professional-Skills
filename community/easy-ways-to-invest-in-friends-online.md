# Easy ways to invest in friends online

Great friendships can be built online but it does take a more personal approach when communicating with your partner or standup team to turn your collaboration into a friendship. Here are a few ways to do that:

- Send personal updates in your Slack messages when you said good morning. For example: "Good morning, I had a great start to the day! The sun is shining today after a week of rain. I always struggle with rainy days because I'm not able to go outside. Anyways- back to coding now. Did you read through the materials?" or "Did you have a good weekend? Mine was great- I spent a lot of time with family and tried a new recipe for enchiladas. Was delicious! What time will we have our check-in call today?".
- Use Loom videos to ask questions or to give answers and add a few personal sentences. [See an example here](https://www.loom.com/share/917287ae195741f69d421360d76ebcb4).
- Share articles, blog posts, quotes that you know your friend will like. For example "Hey I ran into this blog on my LinkedIn. I thought you might like it given that you spoke about a similar topic last week", or "This quote reminded me of the conversation we had about motivation yesterday".
- Send funny memes to each other related to coding, remote work environment or any common interest you have.
- Make time for casual get-to-know-each-other-conversations or play online games with each other.
