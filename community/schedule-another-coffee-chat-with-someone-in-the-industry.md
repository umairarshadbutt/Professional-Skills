- Apply networking skills to schedule a coffee chat with someone in the industry.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Time to schedule another coffee chat

In this exercise, you will set up another virtual coffee meeting with someone in the industry.

### Why is scheduling another coffee chat with someone in the industry important?

We've talked about the importance of networking in past lessons with a focus on how beneficial it is to your job search. Just like any other skill, you have to keep practicing to become good at it!

One of the more frequent outcomes from having these coffee chats is that you can develop connections with peers in the same industry who can connect you to their hiring managers.

Another benefit is that you can gain a mentor, without actually asking someone to mentor you, which can be off-putting to the other person until they have had a chance to get to know you.
