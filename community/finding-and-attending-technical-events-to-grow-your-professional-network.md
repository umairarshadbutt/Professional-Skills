### Why is attending technical events important?

Attending technical events increases your visibility to people in the industry, and gives you a space where you can learn from them, communicate with them, and grow your network. Growing your network is very important for your career as a developer as many opportunities come through our connections and networks.

### Finding tech events to attend

The first part of this lesson focuses on finding tech events to attend and the best websites to help you find them. 

 **Learn more about finding tech events to attend:**

- [TechMeetups.com](https://techmeetups.com/): This is the largest meetup and events site online that offers a wide range of tech events, many of which are free.
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/tech/?page=1): Eventbrite is a great place for finding tech events as well (and many of them are free).
- [Confs.tech](https://confs.tech/): This a crowd-sourced site that lists upcoming tech conferences. You can sort by language and location to find any that might be a good fit for you.

### Preparation before attending an event

Once you have found an event you want to attend, it's time to prepare for it. It is very important to prepare before any event because events are great places to not only learn, but also to build your connections with people in the industry. Preparing for an event beforehand will help you get the most out of it. In this part of the lesson, we will discuss how to prepare before attending an event.

- [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com): This website allows you to DM attendees before an event.
- [Conferencebuddy.io](https://www.conferencebuddy.io/): This website allows you to buddy-up with someone so you can both attend an event together.

### Getting the most out of the event

Once you are at the event, we recommend you follow the guidelines below to ensure you get the most out of the event.

### What to do after attending an event

In this part of the lesson, we will look into things you should do after the event so that you build more relationships and grow your network with the people you have just met.

### How often should I attend events?

You should aim to attend at least 1 event per month. This will allow you to meet new people in the industry on a regular basis. The more events you attend, the more people will begin to know you and become familiar with you. This, in turn, will help keep you at the top of their minds when they hear of a possible job opportunity. Attending events regularly will also help you stay up to date with the changes that are happening in the tech industry so you know how to adapt to those changes.
