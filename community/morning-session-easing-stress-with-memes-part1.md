# Morning session: Easing stress with memes, part 1

## Learning objectives

- Appropriately use humor as a tool for bonding with teammates and managing stress.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Using humor to manage stress

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

It can be hard to handle stress, especially when we feel like we're all alone. Memes use humor to point out problems or issues that we can relate to, making us feel like there are others who know how we feel. Remember [the lawyer who couldn't turn off the cat filter in Zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDNP-SWgn2w).  Many of us could relate

### Why is using humor to manage stress important?

We all experience stress and we have different ways of dealing with that stress. Although stress is a normal feeling nowadays, and you might have experienced it yourself in the past few weeks at Microverse, it is important to know how to deal with it. 

It is best to find healthy ways to deal with stress; humor can be a healthy method of relieving stress. It has been proven that laughing produces endorphins (happy chemicals in the brain) and relaxes the body. The humor in memes can relieve anxiety, and it can also build community as we laugh together. 

### Group discussion

*Spend 5 minutes on this section as a group*

Take a quick look at these [different memes about the challenges of working from home](https://www.virtualvocations.com/blog/work-from-home-lifestyle/best-working-from-home-memes-2020/).  Share with the team 1-2 of the memes that you felt you could relate to and why.

### Making and sharing memes to relief stress

Guiding questions:

- How can you easily create a meme?
- What situations or problems are shared by people on your team?
- What types of images make people in your team think about stressful situations?

## Exercise

### Create your own capstone-themed memes

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813).*

**Spend 15 minutes working on this exercise. Spend a few minutes going over these instructions as a team.**

1. As this is your capstone week, we would like you to create a few capstone-themed memes. Share how you are feeling about the capstone and what are you going through. Memes you create can be silly but should also be respectful and follow the [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-fb637972fe434dccb1004fd572007a59). Your ultimate goal is to make your peers laugh. 
2. Each of you will individually create 3 memes. 
3. Leave 5 minutes at the end of the session to each share **one** of your memes and laugh together with your team. 
4. Save the other 2 memes for part 2 of this activity on Wednesday.
