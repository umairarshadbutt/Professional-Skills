# When is the right time to seek help?

There is nothing wrong with feeling stuck. In fact, the moments in which we feel stuck create a valuable opportunity to grow in our skills and also increase our capacity to handle stressful situations. 

Whenever you are stuck in a problem, first take a pause and a deep breath. This is not the time to directly jump for seeking help. People are happy to help when they see you've put in some effort yourself. 

Now take some time to go through the steps below:  

- Pick which scenario do you find yourself in:
    1. The problem/challenge is slightly difficult to solve yet it's not beyond your skills/capabilities. Venturing into challenging situations opens up new areas of knowledge and unlocks many other opportunities.  Challenges are the place where new learning can happen. 
    2. If you flat-out do not understand what you’re being asked to do, you should always ask for clarification. It’s easy to feel pressure to project independence and competence. But if you say, “Got it!” and head off with no clue what you’ve even been assigned, everyone will suffer in the end.
- In case you picked up the first scenario, remember deadlines often dictate how much help you need, so look carefully at the timelines involved.
- After looking at the timelines, ***determine how much time you can spend on addressing this challenge/problem at hand***.
    1. In case something seems high priority and urgent, then as a good rule of thumb you shouldn't spend more than 30 minutes to address the problem. 
    2. In case it doesn't seem high priority or urgent then work on the next steps of this process and at least work on looking at 2-3 possible solutions before asking someone for help.  
- Go through the questions below in the sequence mentioned and possibly write down your responses as you go through them
    1. What do you think the problem is? 
    2. What exactly do you want to happen?
    3. What is actually happening?
    4. How did you get there? 
    5. What have you tried so far?

In case you have reached the last step and have not tried anything so far, then at least try 2-3 possible solutions. Refer to the next sections for help on figuring out ways to seek answers on your own.
