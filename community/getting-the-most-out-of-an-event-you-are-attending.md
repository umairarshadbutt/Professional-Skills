# Getting the most out of an event you are attending
- **Take notes:** Taking notes during the event can really help solidify the information you are receiving and help you prepare questions for the presenter or the other attendees.
- **Share your contact details and collect theirs:** The event attendees are all potential connections who could potentially refer you to a company, help you with a code review, guide you during an interview process, or build a joint project with you. Don’t leave the event hoping that you’ll see them at another meetup. Give them your LinkedIn/Twitter contact details and ask for theirs too.
