# Morning session: Overcoming imposter syndrome: week 2, part 2

## Learning objectives:

- Continue expanding toolkit for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

Today we will talk more about imposter syndrome and how it relates to job searching.

### Why is this important?

Imposter syndrome can impact you during job searching. It often leads students to believe that they don't have enough work experience to apply to jobs or the feeling that they need to know more coding languages before applying to jobs, or the idea that rejection means they aren't qualified, developers. Job descriptions often ask for more experience than needed, which causes extra anxiety for students. The job-searching process can be nerve-wracking too due to not hearing back from recruiters or hiring managers, needing to do demanding coding challenges or take-home assignments, and sometimes several rejections before getting a job offer.

### Group discussion

Think back to the videos that you watched from Eric, Ariel, and Anthony talking about their experience with imposter syndrome. All three of them talk about a time where they were rejected in the job search. You can review the videos again below if needed.Â *Spend 5 minutes discussing the following questions:*
