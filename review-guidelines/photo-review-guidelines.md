## Mandatory Requirements

### Project requirements

1. The photo must be recent and (to the best of your knowledge) resemble the student’s current appearance.
2. The photo background must be clear and uncluttered, or the background should be blurred/out of focus in order to maintain focus entirely on the student.
3. The student should be wearing professional clothing and looks tidy (combed hair, clean clothes, etc.).
4. The student should be smiling/should appear friendly and should be looking into the camera.
5. The photo must be well-lit and bright; it should be easy to identify the student.
6. The photo should be high-quality (high PPI/resolution); it should not be blurry, grainy, or unclear.
7. The photo should not be poorly edited and should not not have excessive filters or touch-ups.
8. The student’s face must be easy to see (no full-body photos, or photos where the focus is on other objects)
9. The photo must be taken at an angle horizontal from the student’s face; the student should not be staring up or down at the camera.
